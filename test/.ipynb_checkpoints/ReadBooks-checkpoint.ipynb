      "PREFACE\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The excavations carried out in Babylonia and Assyria during the last\n",
      "few years have added immensely to our knowledge of the early history\n",
      "of those countries, and have revolutionized many of the ideas current\n",
      "with regard to the age and character of Babylonian civilization. In\n",
      "the present volume, which deals with the history of Sumer and Akkad,\n",
      "an attempt is made to present this new material in a connected form,\n",
      "and to furnish the reader with the results obtained by recent discovery\n",
      "and research, so far as they affect the earliest historical periods.\n",
      "An account is here given of the dawn of civilization in Mesopotamia,\n",
      "and of the early city-states which were formed from time to time in\n",
      "the lands of Sumer and Akkad, the two great divisions into which\n",
      "Babylonia was at that period divided. The primitive sculpture and\n",
      "other archaeological remains, discovered upon early Babylonian sites,\n",
      "enable us to form a fairly complete picture of the races which in those\n",
      "remote ages inhabited the country. By their help it is possible to\n",
      "realize how the primitive conditions of life were gradually modified,\n",
      "and how from rude beginnings there was developed the comparatively\n",
      "advanced civilization, which was inherited by the later Babylonians and\n",
      "Assyrians and exerted a remarkable influence upon other races of the\n",
      "ancient world.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the course of this history points are noted at which early contact\n",
      "with other lands took place, and it has been found possible in the\n",
      "historic period to trace the paths by which Sumerian culture was\n",
      "carried beyond the limits of Babylonia. Even in prehistoric times it is\n",
      "probable that the great trade routes of the later epoch were already\n",
      "open to traffic, and cultural connections may well have taken place\n",
      "at a time when political contact cannot be historically proved. This\n",
      "fact must be borne in mind in any treatment of the early relations of\n",
      "Babylonia with Egypt. As a result of recent excavation and research it\n",
      "has been found necessary to modify the view that Egyptian culture in\n",
      "its earlier stages was strongly influenced by that of Babylonia. But\n",
      "certain parallels are too striking to be the result of coincidence,\n",
      "and, although the southern Sumerian sites have yielded traces of no\n",
      "prehistoric culture as early as that of the Neolithic and predynastic\n",
      "Egyptians, yet the Egyptian evidence suggests that some contact may\n",
      "have taken place between the prehistoric peoples of North Africa and\n",
      "Western Asia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Far closer were the ties which connected Sumer with Elam, the great\n",
      "centre of civilization which lay upon her eastern border, and recent\n",
      "excavations in Persia have disclosed the extent to which each\n",
      "civilization was of independent development. It was only after the\n",
      "Semitic conquest that Sumerian culture had a marked effect on that\n",
      "of Elam, and Semitic influence persisted in the country even under\n",
      "Sumerian domination. It was also through the Semitic inhabitants\n",
      "of northern Babylonia that cultural elements from both Sumer and\n",
      "Elam passed beyond the Taurus, and, after being assimilated by the\n",
      "Hittites, reached the western and south-western coasts of Asia Minor.\n",
      "An attempt has therefore been made to estimate, in the light of recent\n",
      "discoveries, the manner in which Babylonian culture affected the early\n",
      "civilizations of Egypt, Asia, and the West. Whether through direct or\n",
      "indirect channels, the cultural influence of Sumer and Akkad was felt\n",
      "in varying degrees throughout an area extending from Elam to the Aegean.\n",
      "\n",
      "In view of the after effects of this early civilization, it is of\n",
      "importance to determine the region of the world from which the Sumerian\n",
      "race reached the Euphrates. Until recently it was only possible to\n",
      "form a theory on the subject from evidence furnished by the Sumerians\n",
      "themselves. But explorations in Turkestan, the results of which have\n",
      "now been fully published, enable us to conclude with some confidence\n",
      "that the original home of the Sumerian race is to be sought beyond\n",
      "the mountains to the east of the Babylonian plain. The excavations\n",
      "conducted at Anau near Askhabad by the second Pumpelly Expedition\n",
      "have revealed traces of prehistoric cultures in that region, which\n",
      "present some striking parallels to other early cultures west of the\n",
      "Iranian plateau. Moreover, the physiographical evidence collected by\n",
      "the first Pumpelly Expedition affords an adequate explanation of the\n",
      "racial unrest in Central Asia, which probably gave rise to the Sumerian\n",
      "immigration and to other subsequent migrations from the East.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has long been suspected that a marked change in natural conditions\n",
      "must have taken place during historic times throughout considerable\n",
      "areas in Central Asia. The present comparatively arid condition of\n",
      "Mongolia, for example, is in striking contrast to what it must have\n",
      "been in the era preceding the Mongolian invasion of Western Asia in\n",
      "the thirteenth century, and travellers who have followed the route of\n",
      "Alexander's army, on its return from India through Afghanistan and\n",
      "Persia, have noted the difference in the character of the country at\n",
      "the present day. Evidence of a similar change in natural conditions\n",
      "has now been collected in Russian Turkestan, and the process is\n",
      "also illustrated as a result of the explorations conducted by Dr.\n",
      "Stein, on behalf of the Indian Government, on the borders of the\n",
      "Taklamakan Desert and in the oases of Khotan. It is clear that all\n",
      "these districts, at different periods, were far better watered and more\n",
      "densely populated than they are to-day, and that changes in climatic\n",
      "conditions have reacted on the character of the country in such a way\n",
      "as to cause racial migrations. Moreover, there are indications that\n",
      "the general trend to aridity has not been uniform, and that cycles\n",
      "of greater aridity have been followed by periods when the country\n",
      "was capable of supporting a considerable population. These recent\n",
      "observations have an important bearing on the Sumerian problem, and\n",
      "they have therefore been treated in some detail in Appendix I.\n",
      "\n",
      "The physical effects of such climatic changes would naturally be\n",
      "more marked in mid-continental regions than in districts nearer the\n",
      "coast, and the immigration of Semitic nomads into Syria and Northern\n",
      "Babylonia may possibly have been caused by similar periods of aridity\n",
      "in Central Arabia. However this may be, it is certain that the early\n",
      "Semites reached the Euphrates by way of the Syrian coast, and founded\n",
      "their first Babylonian settlements in Akkad. It is still undecided\n",
      "whether they or the Sumerians were in earliest occupation of Babylonia.\n",
      "The racial character of the Sumerian gods can best be explained on\n",
      "the supposition that the earliest cult-centres in the country were\n",
      "Semitic; but the absence of Semitic idiom from the earliest Sumerian\n",
      "inscriptions is equally valid evidence against the theory. The point\n",
      "will probably not be settled until excavations have been undertaken at\n",
      "such North Babylonian sites as El-OhÃªmir and Tell IbrÃ¢hÃ®m.\n",
      "\n",
      "That the Sumerians played the more important part in originating and\n",
      "moulding Babylonian culture is certain. In government, law, literature\n",
      "and art the Semites merely borrowed from their Sumerian teachers, and,\n",
      "although in some respects they improved upon their models, in each case\n",
      "the original impulse came from the Sumerian race. Hammurabi's Code\n",
      "of Laws, for example, which had so marked an influence on the Mosaic\n",
      "legislation, is now proved to have been of Sumerian origin; and recent\n",
      "research has shown that the later religious and mythological literature\n",
      "of Babylonia and Assyria, by which that of the Hebrews was also so\n",
      "strongly affected, was largely derived from Sumerian sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "The early history of Sumer and Akkad is dominated by the racial\n",
      "conflict between Semites and Sumerians, in the course of which the\n",
      "latter were gradually worsted. The foundation of the Babylonian\n",
      "monarchy marks the close of the political career of the Sumerians as\n",
      "a race, although, as we have seen, their cultural achievements long\n",
      "survived them in the later civilizations of Western Asia. The designs\n",
      "upon the cover of this volume may be taken as symbolizing the dual\n",
      "character of the early population of the country. The panel on the face\n",
      "of the cover represents two Semitic heroes, or mythological beings,\n",
      "watering the humped oxen or buffaloes of the Babylonian plain, and is\n",
      "taken from the seal of Ibni-Sharru, a scribe in the service of the\n",
      "early Akkadian king Shar-Gani-sharri. The panel on the back of the\n",
      "binding is from the Stele of the Vultures and portrays the army of\n",
      "Eannatum trampling on the dead bodies of its foes. The shaven faces of\n",
      "the Sumerian warriors are in striking contrast to the heavily bearded\n",
      "Semitic type upon the seal.\n",
      "\n",
      "A word should, perhaps, be said on two further subjects--the early\n",
      "chronology and the rendering of Sumerian proper names. The general\n",
      "effect of recent research has been to reduce the very early dates,\n",
      "which were formerly in vogue. But there is a distinct danger of the\n",
      "reaction going too far, and it is necessary to mark clearly the points\n",
      "at which evidence gives place to conjecture. It must be admitted that\n",
      "all dates anterior to the foundation of the Babylonian monarchy are\n",
      "necessarily approximate, and while we are without definite points\n",
      "of contact between the earlier and later chronology of Babylonia,\n",
      "it is advisable, as far as possible, to think in periods. In the\n",
      "Chronological Table of early kings and rulers, which is printed as\n",
      "Appendix II., a scheme of chronology has been attempted; and the\n",
      "grounds upon which it is based are summarized in the third chapter, in\n",
      "which the age of the Sumerian civilization is discussed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The transliteration of many of the Sumerian proper names is also\n",
      "provisional. This is largely due to the polyphonous character of\n",
      "the Sumerian signs; but there is also no doubt that the Sumerians\n",
      "themselves frequently employed an ideographic system of expression. The\n",
      "ancient name of the city, the site of which is marked by the mounds\n",
      "of Tello, is an instance in point. The name is written in Sumerian as\n",
      "Shirpurla, with the addition of the determinative for place, and it\n",
      "was formerly assumed that the name was pronounced as Shirpurla by the\n",
      "Sumerians. But there is little doubt that, though written in that way,\n",
      "it was actually pronounced as Lagash, even in the Sumerian period.\n",
      "Similarly the name of its near neighbour and ancient rival, now marked\n",
      "by the mounds of JÃ´kha, was until recently rendered as it is written,\n",
      "Gishkhu or Gishukh; but we now know from a bilingual list that the name\n",
      "was actually pronounced as Umma. The reader will readily understand\n",
      "that in the case of less famous cities, whose names have not yet been\n",
      "found in the later syllabaries and bilingual texts, the phonetic\n",
      "readings may eventually have to be discarded. When the renderings\n",
      "adopted are definitely provisional, a note has been added to that\n",
      "effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "I take this opportunity of thanking Dr. E. A. Wallis Budge for\n",
      "permission to publish photographs of objects illustrating the early\n",
      "history of Sumer and Akkad, which are preserved in the British Museum.\n",

      "The study of origins may undoubtedly be regarded as the most striking\n",
      "characteristic of recent archaeological research. There is a peculiar\n",
      "fascination in tracking any highly developed civilization to its\n",
      "source, and in watching its growth from the rude and tentative efforts\n",
      "of a primitive people to the more elaborate achievements of a later\n",
      "day. And it is owing to recent excavation that we are now in a position\n",
      "to elucidate the early history of the three principal civilizations of\n",
      "the ancient world. The origins of Greek civilization may now be traced\n",
      "beyond the Mycenean epoch, through the different stages of Aegean\n",
      "culture back into the Neolithic age. In Egypt, excavations have not\n",
      "only yielded remains of the early dynastic kings who lived before the\n",
      "pyramid-builders, but they have revealed the existence of Neolithic\n",
      "Egyptians dating from a period long anterior to the earliest written\n",
      "records that have been recovered. Finally, excavations in Babylonia\n",
      "have enabled us to trace the civilization of Assyria and Babylon\n",
      "back to an earlier and more primitive race, which in the remote past\n",
      "occupied the lower plains of the Tigris and Euphrates; while the more\n",
      "recent digging in Persia and Turkestan has thrown light upon other\n",
      "primitive inhabitants of Western Asia, and has raised problems with\n",
      "regard to their cultural connections with the West which were undreamed\n",
      "of a few years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "It will thus be noted that recent excavation and research have\n",
      "furnished the archaeologist with material by means of which he may\n",
      "trace back the history of culture to the Neolithic period, both in the\n",
      "region of the Mediterranean and along the valley of the Nile. That\n",
      "the same achievement cannot be placed to the credit of the excavator\n",
      "of Babylonian sites is not entirely due to defects in the scope or\n",
      "method of his work, but may largely be traced to the character of the\n",
      "country in which the excavations have been carried out. Babylonia is\n",
      "an alluvial country, subject to constant inundation, and the remains\n",
      "and settlements of the Neolithic period were doubtless in many places\n",
      "swept away, and all trace of them destroyed by natural causes. With\n",
      "the advent of the Sumerians began the practice of building cities upon\n",
      "artificial mounds, which preserved the structure of the buildings\n",
      "against flood, and rendered them easier of defence against a foe. It\n",
      "is through excavation in these mounds that the earliest remains of\n",
      "the Sumerians have been recovered; but the still earlier traces of\n",
      "Neolithic times, which at some period may have existed on those very\n",
      "sites, must often have been removed by flood before the mounds were\n",
      "built. The Neolithic and pre-historic remains discovered during the\n",
      "French excavations in the graves of Mussian and at Susa, and by the\n",
      "Pumpelly expedition in the two Kurgans near Anau, do not find their\n",
      "equivalents in the mounds of Babylonia so far as these have yet been\n",
      "examined.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this respect the climate and soil of Babylonia present a striking\n",
      "contrast to those of ancient Egypt. In the latter country the shallow\n",
      "graves of Neolithic man, covered by but a few inches of soil, have\n",
      "remained intact and undisturbed at the foot of the desert hills; while\n",
      "in the upper plateaus along the Nile valley the flints of Palaeolithic\n",
      "man have lain upon the surface of the sand from Palaeolithic times\n",
      "until the present day. But what has happened in so rainless a country\n",
      "as Egypt could never have taken place in Mesopotamia. It is true\n",
      "that a few palaeoliths have been found on the surface of the Syrian\n",
      "desert, but in the alluvial plains of Southern Chaldaea, as in the\n",
      "Egyptian Delta itself, few certain traces of prehistoric man have\n",
      "been forthcoming. Even in the early mat-burials and sarcophagi at FÃ¢ra\n",
      "numerous copper objects[1] and some cylinder-seals have been found,\n",
      "while other cylinders, sealings, and even inscribed tablets, discovered\n",
      "in the same and neighbouring strata, prove that their owners were of\n",
      "the same race as the Sumerians of history, though probably of a rather\n",
      "earlier date.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the earliest Sumerian settlements in Southern Babylonia are\n",
      "to be set back in a comparatively remote period, the race by which\n",
      "they were founded appears at that time to have already attained to a\n",
      "high level of culture. We find them building houses for themselves\n",
      "and temples for their gods of burnt and unburnt brick. They are\n",
      "rich in sheep and cattle, and they have increased the natural\n",
      "fertility of their country by means of a regular system of canals and\n",
      "irrigation-channels. It is true that at this time their sculpture\n",
      "shared the rude character of their pottery, but their main achievement,\n",
      "the invention of a system of writing by means of lines and wedges, is\n",
      "in itself sufficient indication of their comparatively advanced state\n",
      "of civilization. Derived originally from picture-characters, the signs\n",
      "themselves, even in the earliest and most primitive inscriptions as\n",
      "yet recovered, have already lost to a great extent their pictorial\n",
      "character, while we find them employed not only as ideograms to express\n",
      "ideas, but also phonetically for syllables. The use of this complicated\n",
      "system of writing by the early Sumerians presupposes an extremely\n",
      "long period of previous development. This may well have taken place\n",
      "in their original home, before they entered the Babylonian plain. In\n",
      "any case, we must set back in the remote past the beginnings of this\n",
      "ancient people, and we may probably picture their first settlement in\n",
      "the neighbourhood of the Persian Gulf some centuries before the period\n",
      "to which we may assign the earliest of their remains that have actually\n",
      "come down to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "In view of the important _rÃ´le_ played by this early race in the\n",
      "history and development of civilization in Western Asia, it is of\n",
      "interest to recall the fact that not many years ago the very existence\n",
      "of the Sumerians was disputed by a large body of those who occupied\n",
      "themselves with the study of the history and languages of Babylonia.\n",
      "What was known as \"the Sumerian controversy\" engaged the attention of\n",
      "writers on these subjects, and divided them into two opposing schools.\n",
      "At that time not many actual remains of the Sumerians themselves\n",
      "had been recovered, and the arguments in favour of the existence of\n",
      "an early non-Semitic race in Babylonia were in the main drawn from\n",
      "a number of Sumerian texts and compositions which had been found\n",
      "in the palace of the Assyrian king, Ashur-banipal, at Nineveh. A\n",
      "considerable number of the tablets recovered from the royal library\n",
      "were inscribed with a series of compositions, written, it is true, in\n",
      "the cuneiform script, but not in the Semitic language of the Assyrians\n",
      "and Babylonians. To many of these compositions Assyrian translations\n",
      "had been added by the scribes who drew them up, and upon other tablets\n",
      "were found lists of the words employed in the compositions, together\n",
      "with their Assyrian equivalents. The late Sir Henry Rawlinson rightly\n",
      "concluded that these strange texts were written in the language of some\n",
      "race who had inhabited Babylonia before the Semites, while he explained\n",
      "the lists of words as early dictionaries compiled by the Assyrian\n",
      "scribes to help them in their studies of this ancient tongue. The early\n",
      "race he christened \"the Akkadians,\" and although we now know that this\n",
      "name would more correctly describe the early Semitic immigrants who\n",
      "occupied Northern Babylonia, in all other respects his inference was\n",
      "justified. He correctly assigned the non-Semitic compositions that had\n",
      "been recovered to the early non-Semitic population of Babylonia, who\n",
      "are now known by the name of the Sumerians.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir Henry Rawlinson's view was shared by M. Oppert, Professor Schrader,\n",
      "Professor Sayce, and many others, and, in fact, it held the field until\n",
      "a theory was propounded by M. HalÃ©vy to the effect that Sumerian was\n",
      "not a language in the legitimate sense of the term. The contention of\n",
      "M. HalÃ©vy was that the Sumerian compositions were not written in the\n",
      "language of an earlier race, but represented a cabalistic method of\n",
      "writing, invented and employed by the Babylonian priesthood. In his\n",
      "opinion the texts were Semitic compositions, though written according\n",
      "to a secret system or code, and they could only have been read by a\n",
      "priest who had the key and had studied the jealously guarded formulÃ¦.\n",
      "On this hypothesis it followed that the Babylonians and Assyrians were\n",
      "never preceded by a non-Semitic race in Babylonia, and all Babylonian\n",
      "civilization was consequently to be traced to a Semitic origin. The\n",
      "attractions which such a view would have for those interested in\n",
      "ascribing so great an achievement to a Semitic source are obvious, and,\n",
      "in spite of its general improbability, M. HalÃ©vy won over many converts\n",
      "to his theory, among others Professor Delitzsch and a considerable\n",
      "number of the younger school of German critics.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may be noted that the principal support for the theory was derived\n",
      "from an examination of the phonetic values of the Sumerian signs. Many\n",
      "of these, it was correctly pointed out, were obviously derived from\n",
      "Semitic equivalents, and M. HalÃ©vy and his followers forthwith inferred\n",
      "that the whole language was an artificial invention of the Babylonian\n",
      "priests. Why the priests should have taken the trouble to invent so\n",
      "complicated a method of writing was not clear, and no adequate reason\n",
      "could be assigned for such a course. On the contrary, it was shown\n",
      "that the subject-matter of the Sumerian compositions was not of a\n",
      "nature to justify or suggest the necessity of recording them by means\n",
      "of a secret method of writing. A study of the Sumerian texts with the\n",
      "help of the Assyrian translations made it obvious that they merely\n",
      "consisted of incantations, hymns, and prayers, precisely similar to\n",
      "other compositions written in the common tongue of the Babylonians and\n",
      "Assyrians, and thus capable of being read and understood by any scribe\n",
      "acquainted with the ordinary Assyrian or Babylonian character.\n",
      "\n",

      "That Babylonian civilization and culture originated with the Sumerians\n",

      "centres concerns the period at which Sumerians and Semites first came\n",
      "into contact. But before we embark on the discussion of this problem,\n",
      "it will be well to give some account of the physical conditions of the\n",
      "lands which invited the immigration of these early races and formed\n",
      "the theatre of their subsequent history. The lands of Sumer and Akkad\n",
      "were situated in the lower valley of the Euphrates and the Tigris, and\n",
      "corresponded approximately to the country known by classical writers\n",
      "as Babylonia. On the west and south their boundaries are definitely\n",
      "marked by the Arabian desert and the Persian Gulf which, in the\n",
      "earliest period of Sumerian history, extended as far northward as the\n",
      "neighbourhood of the city of Eridu. On the east it is probable that\n",
      "the Tigris originally formed their natural boundary, but this was a\n",
      "direction in which expansion was possible, and their early conflicts\n",
      "with Elam were doubtless provoked by attempts to gain possession of the\n",
      "districts to the east of the river. The frontier in this direction\n",
      "undoubtedly underwent many fluctuations under the rule of the early\n",
      "city-states, but in the later periods, apart from the conquest of\n",
      "Elam, the true area of Sumerian and Semitic authority may be regarded\n",
      "as extending to the lower slopes of the Elamite hills. In the north\n",
      "a political division appears to have corresponded then, as in later\n",
      "times, to the difference in geological structure. A line drawn from a\n",
      "point a little below Samarra on the Tigris before its junction with the\n",
      "Adhem to HÃ®t on the Euphrates marks the division between the slightly\n",
      "elevated and undulating plain and the dead level of the alluvium, and\n",
      "this may be regarded as representing the true boundary of Akkad on the\n",
      "north. The area thus occupied by the two countries was of no very great\n",
      "extent, and it was even less than would appear from a modern map of the\n",
      "Tigris and Euphrates valley. For not only was the head of the Persian\n",
      "Gulf some hundred and twenty, or hundred and thirty, miles distant from\n",
      "the present coast-line, but the ancient course of the Euphrates below\n",
      "Babylon lay considerably to the east of its modern bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general character the lands of Sumer and Akkad consist of a flat\n",
      "alluvial plain, and form a contrast to the northern half of the Tigris\n",
      "and Euphrates valley, known to the Greeks as Mesopotamia and Assyria.\n",
      "These latter regions, both in elevation and geological structure,\n",
      "resemble the Syro-Arabian desert, and it is only in the neighbourhood\n",
      "of the two great streams and their tributaries that cultivation can\n",
      "be carried out on any extensive scale. Here the country at a little\n",
      "distance from the rivers becomes a stony plain, serving only as\n",
      "pasture-land when covered with vegetation after the rains of winter\n",
      "and the early spring. In Sumer and Akkad, on the other hand, the\n",
      "rivers play a far more important part. The larger portion of the\n",
      "country itself is directly due to their action, having been formed by\n",
      "the deposit which they have carried down into the waters of the Gulf.\n",
      "Through this alluvial plain of their own formation the rivers take a\n",
      "winding course, constantly changing their direction in consequence of\n",
      "the silting up of their beds and the falling in of the banks during the\n",
      "annual floods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the two rivers the Tigris, owing to its higher and stronger banks,\n",
      "has undergone less change than the Euphrates. It is true that during\n",
      "the Middle Ages its present channel below KÃ»t el-'AmÃ¢ra was entirely\n",
      "disused, its waters flowing by the Shatt el-Hai into the Great Swamp\n",
      "which extended from KÃ»fa on the Euphrates to the neighbourhood of\n",
      "Kurna, covering an area fifty miles across and nearly two hundred\n",
      "miles in length.[3] But in the Sassanian period the Great Swamp, the\n",
      "formation of which was due to neglect of the system of irrigation under\n",
      "the early caliphs, did not exist, and the river followed its present\n",
      "channel.[4] It is thus probable that during the earlier periods of\n",
      "Babylonian history the main body of water passed this way into the\n",
      "Gulf, but the Shatt el-Hai may have represented a second and less\n",
      "important branch of the stream.[5]\n",
      "\n",
      "The change in the course of the Euphrates has been far more marked, the\n",
      "position of its original bed being indicated by the mounds covering\n",
      "the sites of early cities, which extend through the country along\n",
      "the practically dry beds of the Shatt en-NÃ®l and the Shatt el-KÃ¢r,\n",
      "considerably to the east of its present channel. The mounds of AbÃ»\n",
      "Habba, Tell IbrÃ¢hÃ®m, El-OhÃªmir and Niffer, marking the sites of the\n",
      "important cities of Sippar, Cutha, Kish[6] and Nippur, all lie to the\n",
      "east of the river, the last two on the ancient bed of the Shatt en-NÃ®l.\n",
      "Similarly, the course of the Shatt el-KÃ¢r, which formed an extension\n",
      "of the Shatt en-NÃ®l below SÃ»k el-'Afej passes the mounds of AbÃ» Hatab\n",
      "(Kisurra), FÃ¢ra (Shuruppak) and HammÃ¢m. Warka (Erech) stands on a\n",
      "further continuation of the Shatt en-NÃ®l,[7] while still more to the\n",
      "eastward are the mounds of BismÃ¢ya and JÃ´kha, representing the cities\n",
      "of Adab and Umma.[8] Senkera, the site of Larsa, also lies considerably\n",
      "to the east of the present stream, and the only city besides Babylon\n",
      "which now stands comparatively near the present bed of the Euphrates is\n",
      "Ur. The positions of the ancient cities would alone be sufficient proof\n",
      "that, since the early periods of Babylonian history, the Euphrates has\n",
      "considerably changed its course.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abundant evidence that this was the case is furnished by the\n",
      "contemporary inscriptions that have been recovered. The very name of\n",
      "the Euphrates was expressed by an ideogram signifying \"the River of\n",
      "Sippar,\" from which we may infer that Sippar originally stood upon its\n",
      "banks. A Babylonian contract of the period of the First Dynasty is\n",
      "dated in the year in which Samsu-iluna constructed the wall of Kish\n",
      "\"on the bank of the Euphrates,\"[9] proving that either the main stream\n",
      "from Sippar, or a branch from Babylon, flowed by El-OhÃªmir. Still\n",
      "further south the river at Nippur, marked as at El-OhÃªmir by the dry\n",
      "bed of the Shatt en-NÃ®l, is termed \"the Euphrates of Nippur,\" or simply\n",
      "\"the Euphrates\" on contract-tablets found upon the site.[10] Moreover,\n",
      "the city of Shurippak or Shuruppak, the native town of Ut-napishtim,\n",
      "is described by him in the Gilgamesh epic as lying \"on the bank of\n",
      "the Euphrates\"; and Hammurabi, in one of his letters to Sin-idinnam,\n",
      "bids him clear out the stream of the Euphrates \"from Larsa as far as\n",
      "Ur.\"[11] These references in the early texts cover practically the\n",
      "whole course of the ancient bed of the Euphrates, and leave but a few\n",
      "points open to conjecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the north it is clear that at an early period a second branch broke\n",
      "away from the Euphrates at a point about half-way between Sippar\n",
      "and the modern town of FalÃ»ja, and, after flowing along the present\n",
      "bed of the river as far as Babylon, rejoined the main stream of the\n",
      "Euphrates either at, or more probably below, the city of Kish. It\n",
      "was the extension of these western channels which afterwards drained\n",
      "the earlier bed, and we may conjecture that its waters were diverted\n",
      "back to the Euphrates at this early period by artificial means.[12]\n",
      "The tendency of the river was always to break away westward, and the\n",
      "latest branch of the stream, still further to the west, left the river\n",
      "above Babylon at Musayyib. The fact that Birs, the site of Borsippa,\n",
      "stands upon its upper course, suggests an early date for its origin,\n",
      "but it is quite possible that the first city on this site, in view\n",
      "of its proximity to Babylon, obtained its water-supply by means of a\n",
      "system of canals. However this may be, the present course of this most\n",
      "western branch is marked by the Nahr HindÃ®ya, the Bahr Nejef, and the\n",
      "Shatt 'AteshÃ¢n, which rejoins the Euphrates after passing SamÃ¢wa. In\n",
      "the Middle Ages the Great Swamps started at KÃ»fa, and it is possible\n",
      "that even in earlier times, during periods of inundation, some of the\n",
      "surplus water from the river may have emptied itself into swamps or\n",
      "marshy land below Borsippa.\n",
      "\n",
      "The exact course of the Euphrates south of Nippur during the earliest\n",
      "periods is still a matter for conjecture, and it is quite possible\n",
      "that its waters reached the Persian Gulf through two, if not three,\n",
      "mouths. It is certain that the main stream passed the cities of\n",
      "Kisurra, Shuruppak, and Erech, and eventually reached the Gulf below\n",
      "Ur. Whether after leaving Erech it turned eastward to Larsa, and so\n",
      "southward to Ur, or whether it flowed from Erech direct to Ur, and\n",
      "Larsa lay upon another branch, is not yet settled, though the reference\n",
      "in Hammurabi's letter may be cited in favour of the former view.\n",
      "Another point of uncertainty concerns the relation of Adab and Umma to\n",
      "the stream. The mounds of BismÃ¢ya and JÃ´kha, which mark their sites,\n",
      "lie to the east, off the line of the Shatt el-KÃ¢r, and it is quite\n",
      "possible that they were built upon an eastern branch of the river which\n",
      "may have joined the Shatt el-Hai above Lagash, and so have mingled with\n",
      "the waters of the Tigris before reaching the Gulf.[13]\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of these points of uncertainty, it will be noted that every\n",
      "city of Sumer and Akkad, the site of which has been referred to, was\n",
      "situated on the Euphrates or one of its branches, not upon the Tigris,\n",
      "and the only exception to this rule appears to have been Opis, the\n",
      "most northern city of Akkad. The preference for the Euphrates may be\n",
      "explained by the fact that the Tigris is swift and its banks are high,\n",
      "and it thus offers far less facilities for irrigation. The Euphrates\n",
      "with its lower banks tends during the time of high water to spread\n",
      "itself over the surrounding country, which doubtless suggested to\n",
      "the earliest inhabitants the project of regulating and utilizing the\n",
      "supply of water by means of reservoirs and canals. Another reason\n",
      "for the preference may be traced to the slower fall of the water in\n",
      "the Euphrates during the summer months. With the melting of the snow\n",
      "in the mountain ranges of the Taurus and Niphates during the early\n",
      "spring, the first flood-water is carried down by the swift stream\n",
      "of the Tigris, which generally begins to rise in March, and, after\n",
      "reaching its highest level in the early part of May, falls swiftly and\n",
      "returns to its summer level by the middle of June. The Euphrates, on\n",
      "the other hand, rises about a fortnight later, and continues at a high\n",
      "level for a much longer period. Even in the middle of July there is a\n",
      "considerable body of water in the river, and it is not until September\n",
      "that its lowest level is reached. On both streams irrigation-machines\n",
      "were doubtless employed, as they are at the present day,[14] but in\n",
      "the Euphrates they were only necessary when the water in the river had\n",
      "fallen below the level of the canals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between the lands of Sumer and Akkad there was no natural division such\n",
      "as marks them off from the regions of Assyria and Mesopotamia in the\n",
      "north. While the north-eastern half of the country bore the name of\n",
      "Akkad, and the south-eastern portion at the head of the Persian Gulf\n",
      "was known as Sumer, the same alluvial plain stretches southward from\n",
      "one to the other without any change in its general character. Thus\n",
      "some difference of opinion has previously existed, as to the precise\n",
      "boundary which separated the two lands, and additional confusion has\n",
      "been introduced by the rather vague use of the name Akkad during\n",
      "the later Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian periods. Thus Ashur-bani-pal,\n",
      "when referring to the capture of NanÃ¢'s statue by the Elamites, puts\n",
      "E-anna, the temple of NanÃ¢ in Erech, among the temples of the land of\n",
      "Akkad, a statement which has led to the view that Akkad extended as\n",
      "far south as Erech.[15] But it has been pointed out that on similar\n",
      "evidence furnished by an Assyrian letter, it would be possible to\n",
      "regard Eridu, the most southern Sumerian city as in Akkad, not in\n",
      "Sumer.[16] The explanation is to be found in the fact that by the\n",
      "Assyrians, whose southern border marched with Akkad, the latter name\n",
      "was often used loosely for the whole of Babylonia. Such references\n",
      "should not therefore be employed for determining the original limits of\n",
      "the two countries, and it is necessary to rely only upon information\n",
      "supplied by texts of a period earlier than that in which the original\n",
      "distinction between the two names had become blurred.\n",
      "\n",
      "From references to different cities in the early texts, it is possible\n",
      "to form from their context, a very fair idea of what the Sumerians\n",
      "themselves regarded as the limits of their own land. For instance,\n",
      "from the Tello inscriptions there is no doubt that Lagash was in Sumer.\n",
      "Thus the god Ningirsu, when informing Gudea, patesi of Lagash, that\n",
      "prosperity shall follow the building of E-ninnÃ», promises that oil and\n",
      "wool shall be abundant in Sumer;[17] the temple itself, which was in\n",
      "Lagash, is recorded to have been built of bricks of Sumer;[18] and,\n",
      "after the building of the temple was finished, Gudea prays that the\n",
      "land may rest in security, and that Sumer may be at the head of the\n",
      "countries.[19] Again, Lugal-zaggisi, who styles himself King of the\n",
      "Land, i.e. the land of Sumer,[20] mentions among cities subject to\n",
      "him, Erech, Ur, Larsa, and Umma,[21] proving that they were regarded\n",
      "as Sumerian towns. The city of Kesh, whose goddess Ninkharsag is\n",
      "mentioned on the Stele of the Vultures, with the gods of Sumerian towns\n",
      "as guaranteeing a treaty between Lagash and Umma,[22] was probably in\n",
      "Sumer, and so, too, must have been Isin, which gave a line of rulers to\n",
      "Sumer and Akkad in succession to Ur; about Eridu in the extreme south\n",
      "there could be no two opinions. On the other hand, in addition to the\n",
      "city of Agade or Akkad, Sippar, Kish, Opis, Cutha, Babylon and Borsippa\n",
      "are certainly situated beyond the limits of Sumer and belong to the\n",
      "land of Akkad in the north. Between the two groups lay Nippur, rather\n",
      "nearer to the southern than to the northern cities, and occupying the\n",
      "unique position of a central shrine. There is little doubt that the\n",
      "town was originally regarded as within the limits of Sumer, but from\n",
      "its close association with any claimant to the hegemony, whether in\n",
      "Sumer or in Akkad, it acquired in course of time a certain intermediate\n",
      "position, on the boundary line, as it were, between the two countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the names Sumer and Akkad, it would seem that neither was in use in\n",
      "the earliest historical periods, though the former was probably the\n",
      "older of the two. At a comparatively early date the southern district\n",
      "as a whole was referred to simply as \"the Land,\"[23] _par excellence_,\n",
      "and it is probable that the ideogram by which the name of Sumer was\n",
      "expressed, was originally used with a similar meaning.[24] The twin\n",
      "title, Sumer and Akkad, was first regularly employed as a designation\n",
      "for the whole country by the kings of Ur, who united the two halves of\n",
      "the land into a single empire, and called themselves kings of Sumer\n",
      "and Akkad. The earlier Semitic kings of Agade or Akkad[25] expressed\n",
      "the extent of their empire by claiming to rule \"the four quarters (of\n",
      "the world),\" while the still earlier king Lugal-zaggisi, in virtue\n",
      "of his authority in Sumer, adopted the title \"King of the Land.\" In\n",
      "the time of the early city-states, before the period of Eannatum, no\n",
      "general title for the whole of Sumer or of Akkad is met with in the\n",
      "inscriptions that have been recovered. Each city with its surrounding\n",
      "territory formed a compact state in itself, and fought with its\n",
      "neighbours for local power and precedence. At this time the names of\n",
      "the cities occur by themselves in the titles of their rulers, and it\n",
      "was only after several of them had been welded into a single state that\n",
      "the need was felt for a more general name or designation. Thus, to\n",
      "speak of Akkad, and even perhaps of Sumer, in the earliest period, is\n",
      "to be guilty of an anachronism, but it is a pardonable one. The names\n",
      "may be employed as convenient geographical terms, as, for instance,\n",
      "when referring to the country as a whole, we speak of Babylonia during\n",

      "description of the early sites.\n",
      "\n",
      "The greater part of our knowledge of early Sumerian history has been\n",
      "derived from the wonderfully successful series of excavations carried\n",
      "out by the late M. de Sarzec at Tello,[1] between 1877 and 1900, and\n",
      "continued for some months in 1903 by Captain (now Commandant) Gaston\n",

      "and lie a few miles to the north-east of the modern village of Shatra,\n",
      "to the east of the Shatt el-Hai, and about an hour's ride from the\n",
      "present course of the stream. It is evident, however, that the city was\n",
      "built upon the stream, which at this point may originally have formed a\n",
      "branch of the Euphrates,[2] for there are traces of a dry channel upon\n",
      "its western side.\n",
      "\n",
      "The name of the city is expressed by the signs _shir-pur-la_ (_-ki_),\n",
      "which are rendered in a bilingual incantation-text as Lagash.[3]\n",
      "Hitherto it has been generally held that Shirpurla represented the\n",
      "Sumerian name of the city, which was known to the later Semitic\n",
      "inhabitants as Lagash, in much the same way as Akkad was the Semitic\n",
      "name for Agade, though in the latter case the original name was taken\n",
      "over. But the prolonged excavations carried out in the mounds of\n",
      "Tello have failed to bring to light any Babylonian remains later than\n",

      "destroyed, and to have lain deserted and forgotten until it was once\n",
      "more inhabited in the second century B.C. Thus it is difficult to find\n",
      "a reason for a second name. We may therefore assume that the place\n",
      "was called Lagash by the Sumerians, and that the signs which can be\n",
      "read as Shirpurla represent a traditional ideographic way of writing\n",
      "the name among the Sumerians themselves. There is no difficulty in\n",

      "discovery that some of the later bricks bore the name of Hadadnadinakhe\n",
      "in Aramean and Greek characters, proving that the building belonged\n",

      "hair of the head and wore long beards. A slight modification in the\n",

      "only from the chin; while they also appear to have cut the hair short\n",
      "in the manner of the Arabs or Nabateans of the Sinai peninsula.[35]\n",
      "The Semites who were settled in Babylonia during the earlier period,\n",
      "retained the moustache as well as the beard, and wore their hair long.\n",
      "While recognizing the slight change of custom, introduced for a time\n",
      "during the West Semitic domination, the practice of wearing hair and\n",
      "beard was a Semitic characteristic during all periods of history. The\n",
      "phrase \"the black-headed ones,\" which is of frequent occurrence in the\n",

      "Another distinctive characteristic, almost equally striking, may\n",
      "be seen in the features of the face as represented in the outline\n",

      "that the Sumerian had a prominent nose, which forms, indeed, his most\n",

      "later Sumerian patesis this rough garment has been given up in favour\n",
      "of a great shawl or mantle, decorated with a border, which was worn\n",
      "over the left shoulder, and, falling in straight folds, draped the body\n",
      "with its opening in front.[37] Both these Sumerian forms of garment\n",
      "are of quite different types from the Semitic loin-cloth worn by\n",
      "NarÃ¢m-Sin on his stele of victory, and the Semitic plaid in which he is\n",

      "with the end thrown over the left shoulder. It has no slit, or opening,\n",
      "in front like the later Sumerian mantle, and, on the other hand, was\n",

      "But they have shaven faces, and, in view of the fact that on the same\n",
      "monument all the dead upon the field of battle and in the burial mounds\n",
      "have shaven heads, like those of the Sumerians assisting at the burial\n",
      "and the sacrificial rites, we may regard the hair of Eannatum and his\n",
      "warriors as wigs, worn like the wigs of the Egyptians, on special\n",
      "occasions and particularly in battle. The other inconsistency arises\n",
      "from the dress worn by Hammurabi on his monuments. This is not the\n",
      "Semitic plaid, but the Sumerian fringed mantle, and we may conjecture\n",
      "that, as he wrote his votive inscriptions in the Sumerian as well as in\n",
      "the Semitic language, so, too, he may have symbolized his rule in Sumer\n",
      "by the adoption of the Sumerian form of dress.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is natural that upon monuments of the later period from Tello\n",
      "both racial types should be represented. The fragments of sculpture\n",
      "illustrated in Figs. 6 and 7 may possibly belong to the same monument,\n",
      "and, if so, we must assign it to a Semitic king.[39] That on the left\n",

      "wears a curled beard trimmed to a point, and hair that falls on the\n",
      "shoulders in two great twisted tresses; the face of the figure on his\n",
      "left is broken, but the head is clearly shaved. A similar mixture of\n",
      "types upon a single monument occurs on a large fragment of sculpture\n",

      "their outer edge with reliefs. They were perforated vertically with\n",
      "two holes which were intended to support maces, or other votive\n",

      "will be noticed that the chief on the left, who carries a bent club,\n",
      "has long hair falling on the shoulders and is bearded. Four of his\n",
      "followers on another fragment (Fig. 10) also have long hair and beards.\n",

      "assign very remote dates to the earlier rulers of Sumer and Akkad,\n",
      "and although the chronological systems in vogue necessitated enormous\n",
      "gaps in our knowledge of history, it was confidently assumed that\n",
      "these would be filled as a result of future excavation. Blank periods\n",
      "of a thousand years or more were treated as of little account by many\n",
      "writers. The hoary antiquity ascribed to the earliest rulers had in\n",
      "itself an attraction which outweighed the inconvenience of spreading\n",
      "the historical material to cover so immense a space in time. But\n",
      "excavation, so far from filling the gaps, has tended distinctly to\n",
      "reduce them, and the chronological systems of the later Assyrian\n",
      "and Babylonian scribes, which were formerly regarded as of primary\n",
      "importance, have been brought into discredit by the scribes themselves.\n",
      "From their own discrepancies it has been shown that the native\n",
      "chronologists could make mistakes in their reckoning, and a possible\n",
      "source of error has been disclosed in the fact that some of the early\n",
      "dynasties, which were formerly regarded as consecutive, were, actually,\n",
      "contemporaneous. Recent research on this subject has thus resulted in\n",
      "a considerable reduction of the early dates, and the different epochs\n",
      "in the history of Sumer and Akkad, which were at one time treated as\n",
      "isolated phenomena, have been articulated to form a consistent whole.\n",
      "But the tendency now is to carry the reaction rather too far, and to\n",
      "compress certain periods beyond the limits of the evidence. It will be\n",
      "well to summarize the problems at issue, and to indicate the point at\n",
      "which evidence gives place to conjecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "In attempting to set limits to the earlier periods of Sumerian history,\n",
      "it is still impossible to do more than form a rough and approximate\n",
      "estimate of their duration. For in dealing with the chronology of\n",
      "the remoter ages, we are, to a great extent, groping in the dark.\n",
      "The material that has been employed for settling the order of the\n",
      "early kings, and for determining their periods, falls naturally into\n",
      "three main classes. The most important of our sources of information\n",
      "consists of the contemporary inscriptions of the early kings\n",
      "themselves, which have been recovered upon the sites of the ancient\n",
      "cities in Babylonia.[1] The inscriptions frequently give genealogies\n",
      "of the rulers whose achievements they record, and they thus enable\n",
      "us to ascertain the sequence of the kings and the relative dates at\n",
      "which they reigned. This class of evidence also makes it possible to\n",
      "fix certain points of contact between the separate lines of rulers\n",
      "who maintained an independent authority within the borders of their\n",
      "city-states.\n",
      "\n",
      "A second class of material, which is of even greater importance for\n",
      "settling the chronology of the later Sumerian epoch, comprises the\n",
      "chronological documents drawn up by early scribes, who incorporated in\n",
      "the form of lists and tables the history of their own time and that of\n",
      "their predecessors. The system of dating documents which was in vogue\n",
      "was not a very convenient one from the point of view of those who used\n",
      "it, but it has furnished us with an invaluable summary of the principal\n",
      "events which took place for long periods at a time. The early dwellers\n",
      "in Babylonia did not reckon dates by the years of the reigning king,\n",
      "as did the later Babylonians, but they cited each year by the event\n",
      "of greatest importance which took place in it. Such events consisted\n",
      "in the main of the building of temples, the performance of religious\n",
      "ceremonies, and the conquest of neighbouring cities and states. Thus\n",
      "the dates upon private and official documents often furnish us with\n",
      "historical information of considerable importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the disadvantages of the system are obvious, for an event might\n",
      "appear of great importance in one city and might be of no interest\n",
      "to another situated at some distance from it. Thus it happened that\n",
      "the same event was not employed throughout the whole country for\n",
      "designating a particular year, and we have evidence that different\n",
      "systems of dating were employed in different cities. Moreover, it would\n",
      "have required an unusually good memory to fix the exact period of a\n",
      "document by a single reference to an event which took place in the year\n",
      "when it was drawn up, more especially after the system had been in use\n",
      "for a considerable time. Thus, in order to fix the relative dates of\n",
      "documents without delay, the scribes compiled lists of the titles of\n",
      "the years, arranged in order under the reigns of the successive kings,\n",
      "and these were doubtless stored in some archive-chamber, where they\n",
      "were easily accessible in the case of any dispute arising with regard\n",
      "to the date of a particular year. It is fortunate that some of these\n",
      "early Sumerian date-lists have been recovered, and we are furnished\n",
      "by them with an outline of Sumerian history, which has the value of\n",
      "a contemporary record.[2] They have thrown light upon a period of\n",
      "which at one time we knew little, and they have served to remove more\n",
      "than one erroneous supposition. Thus the so-called Second Dynasty of\n",
      "Ur was proved by them to have been non-existent, and the consequent\n",
      "reduplication of kings bearing the names of Ur-Engur and Dungi was\n",
      "shown to have had no foundation in fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the compilation of lists of the separate years it was but a step\n",
      "to the classification of the reigns of the kings themselves and their\n",
      "arrangement in the form of dynasties. Among the mass of tablets\n",
      "recovered from Niffer has been found a fragment of one of these early\n",
      "dynastic tablets,[3] which supplements the date-lists and is of the\n",
      "greatest value for settling the chronology of the later period. The\n",

      "the length of their respective reigns, and it further states that the\n",
      "Dynasty of Isin directly succeeded that of Ur. This document fixes\n",
      "once for all the length of the period to which it refers, and it is\n",
      "much to be regretted that so little of the text has been recovered.\n",

      "a list of various dynasties which ruled in Babylonia from the very\n",
      "earliest times down to the date of its compilation, though many of the\n",
      "dynasties enumerated were doubtless contemporaneous. It was on the\n",
      "base of such documents as this dynastic list that the famous dynastic\n",
      "tablet was compiled for the library of Ashurbani-pal at Nineveh, and\n",
      "the existence of such lengthy dynastic records must have contributed to\n",
      "the exaggerated estimate for the beginnings of Babylonian history which\n",

      "reliance has in the past been placed upon a notice of one of the early\n",
      "rulers of Babylonia, which occurs in an inscription of the last king of\n",
      "the Neo-Babylonian empire. On a clay cylinder of Nabonidus, which is\n",

      "reduction in the date of the First Dynasty of Babylon, necessitated\n",
      "by the proof that the first three dynasties of the Kings' List were\n",
      "partly contemporaneous, made its discrepancy with Nabonidus's figures\n",

      "explanation of so high a figure resulting from his calculations. For\n",
      "his scribes in all good faith may have reckoned as consecutive a\n",
      "number of early dynasties which had been contemporaneous.[8] The final\n",
      "disproof of the figure is furnished by evidence of an archaeological\n",

      "the date 2232 B.C., which probably represents the beginning of\n",
      "the non-mythical dynasties of Berossus,[12] has hitherto played a\n",
      "considerable part in modern schemes of chronology, and, in spite of the\n",
      "fact that no amount of ingenuity can reconcile his dynasties with those\n",

      "the beginning of Dynasty I. of the Kings' List as affording a fixed\n",
      "and certain point from which to start calculations. But this can only\n",
      "be done by assuming that some of the kings of the Sea-country ruled\n",
      "over the whole of Babylonia, an assumption that is negatived by such\n",
      "historical and archaeological evidence as we possess.[13] It is safer\n",
      "to treat the date 2232 B.C. as without significance, and to follow the\n",
      "evidence in confining the kings of the Sea-country to their own land.\n",

      "The second important point on which opinion is not agreed, concerns\n",
      "the relation of the First Dynasty of Babylon to that of Isin. From the\n",
      "Nippur dynastic list we know the duration of the dynasties of Ur and\n",
      "Isin, and if we could connect the latter with the First Dynasty of\n",
      "Babylon, we should be able to carry a fixed chronology at least as far\n",
      "back as the age of Gudea. Such a point of connection has been suggested\n",
      "in the date-formula for the seventeenth year of Sin-muballit's reign,\n",

      "terminology.[15] It would thus appear that no long interval separated\n",
      "the two dynasties from one another. We have seen that the foundation\n",

      "synchronism is not sufficiently strong to justify its acceptance.[18]\n",
      "By placing Urukagina at 2800 B.C., we obtain for Ur-NinÃ¢ an approximate\n",

      "Sumerian civilization, but its achievements are by no means belittled\n",
      "by the compression of its period of development. It is not suggested\n",
      "that this date marks the beginning of Sumerian culture, for, as we\n",

      "the interest attaching to the Sumerian original is largely derived\n",
      "from its effects, and its study may be undertaken mainly with the view\n",
      "of elucidating a later development. But one department of Sumerian\n",
      "activity forms a striking exception to this rule. The arts of sculpture\n",
      "and engraving, as practised by the Sumerians, are well worthy of study\n",
      "on their own account, for while their work in all periods is marked by\n",
      "spirit and originality, that of the later time reaches a remarkable\n",
      "standard of excellence. The improvement in technique observable in\n",
      "the later period may largely be due to the influence of Semitic work,\n",
      "which was derived from Sumer and reacted in its turn on the parent\n",
      "stem. But the original impulse to artistic production was of purely\n",
      "Sumerian origin, and it is possible to trace the gradual development\n",
      "of its products from the rudest reliefs of the archaic period to the\n",
      "finished sculpture of Gudea's reign.[21] The character of the Semitic\n",
      "art of Akkad was secondary and derivative, though the Semites certainly\n",
      "improved on what they borrowed; in that of the Sumerians the seeds\n",
      "of its later excellence may be detected from the beginning. The most\n",
      "ancient of the sculptured reliefs of the Sumerians are very rudely\n",
      "cut, and their age is attested not only by their primitive character,\n",
      "but also by the linear form of the writing which is found upon them.\n",
      "These, owing to their smaller size, are the best preserved, for the\n",
      "later reliefs, which belong to the period when Sumerian art reached its\n",
      "fullest development, are unfortunately represented only by fragments.\n",
      "But they suffice to show the spirit which animated these ancient\n",
      "craftsmen, and enabled them successfully to overcome difficulties\n",
      "of technique which were carefully avoided by the later sculptors of\n",
      "Assyria. To take a single instance, we may note the manner in which\n",
      "they represented the heads of the principal figures of a composition in\n",
      "full-face, and did not seek to avoid the difficulty of foreshortening\n",
      "the features by a monotonous arrangement in profile. A good example\n",
      "of their bolder method of composition is afforded by the relief of a\n",
      "god, generally identified with Ningirsu, which dates from the epoch\n",

      "and angular treatment is sufficient indication of the very archaic\n",

      "Some archaic characteristics may still be noted, such as the springing\n",
      "tufts of hair at the joints of the hind legs; but the general treatment\n",

      "difficulties in consequence of its brittle and scaly surface. Pieces\n",
      "have been found, however, on which designs have been cut, and these\n",
      "were most frequently employed for enriching the handles of knives\n",
      "and daggers. The panels in the accompanying blocks will serve to\n",

      "In their origin the great cities of Babylonia were little more\n",
      "than collections of rude huts constructed at first of reeds cut in\n",
      "the marshes, and gradually giving place to rather more substantial\n",
      "buildings of clay and sun-dried brick. From the very beginning it would\n",
      "appear that the shrine of the local god played an important part in the\n",
      "foundation and subsequent development of each centre of population.\n",
      "Of the prehistoric period in Babylonia we know little, but it may be\n",
      "assumed that, already at the time of the Sumerian immigration, rude\n",
      "settlements had been formed around the cult-centres of local gods.\n",
      "This, at any rate, was the character of each town or city of the\n",
      "Sumerians themselves during the earliest periods to which we can trace\n",
      "back their history. At FÃ¢ra, the most primitive Sumerian site that has\n",
      "yet been examined, we find the god Shuruppak giving his own name to the\n",
      "city around his shrine, and Ningirsu of Lagash dominates and directs\n",
      "his people from the first. Other city-gods, who afterwards became\n",
      "powerful deities in the Babylonian pantheon, are already in existence,\n",
      "and have acquired in varying degrees their later characters. Enki of\n",
      "Eridu is already the god of the deep, the shrine of Enzu or Nannar in\n",
      "the city of Ur is a centre of the moon-cult, Babbar of Larsa appears\n",
      "already as a sun-god and the dispenser of law and justice, while the\n",
      "most powerful Sumerian goddess, Ninni or NanÃ¢ of Erech, already has her\n",
      "shrine and worshippers in the city of her choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "By what steps the city-gods acquired their later characters it is\n",
      "impossible now to say, but we may assume that the process was a\n",
      "gradual one. In the earlier stages of its history the character of\n",
      "the local god, like that of his city, must have been far more simple\n",
      "and primitive than it appears to us as seen in the light of its later\n",
      "development. The authority of each god did not extend beyond the limits\n",
      "of his own people's territory. Each city was content to do battle on\n",
      "his behalf, and the defeat of one was synonymous with the downfall of\n",
      "the other. With the gradual amalgamation of the cities into larger\n",
      "states, the god of the predominant city would naturally take precedence\n",
      "over those of the conquered or dependent towns, and to the subsequent\n",
      "process of adjustment we may probably trace the relationships between\n",
      "the different deities and the growth of a pantheon. That Enki should\n",
      "have been the god of the deep from the beginning is natural enough\n",
      "in view of Eridu's position on an expanse of water connected with\n",
      "the Persian Gulf. But how it came about that Ur was the centre of a\n",
      "moon-cult, or that Sippar in the north and Larsa in the south were\n",
      "peculiarly associated with the worship of the sun, are questions\n",
      "which cannot as yet be answered, though it is probable that future\n",
      "excavations on their sites may throw some light upon the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the case of one city excavation has already enabled us to trace the\n",
      "gradual growth of its temple and the surrounding habitations during a\n",
      "considerable portion of their history. The city of Nippur stands in a\n",
      "peculiar relation to others in Sumer and Akkad, as being the central\n",
      "shrine in the two countries and the seat of Enlil, the chief of the\n",
      "gods. Niffer, or Nuffar, is the name by which the mounds marking its\n",
      "site are still known. They have been long deserted, and, like the sites\n",
      "of many other ancient cities in Babylonia and Assyria, no modern town\n",
      "or village is built upon them or in their immediate neighbourhood. The\n",
      "nearest small town is SÃ»k el-'Afej, about four miles to the south,\n",
      "lying on the eastern edge of the Afej marshes, which begin to the\n",
      "south of Niffer and stretch away to the west. The nearest large town\n",
      "is DÃ®wÃ¢nÃ®ya, on the left bank of the Euphrates twenty miles to the\n",
      "south-west. In the summer the marshes in the neighbourhood of the\n",
      "mounds consist of pools of water connected by channels through the\n",
      "reed-beds, but in the spring, when the snows have melted in the Taurus\n",
      "and the mountains of Kurdistan, the flood-water converts the marshes\n",
      "into a vast lagoon, and all that meets the eye are isolated date-palms\n",
      "and a few small hamlets built on rising knolls above the water-level.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although, during the floods, Niffer is at times nearly isolated, the\n",
      "water never approaches within a considerable distance of the actual\n",
      "mounds. This is not due to any natural configuration of the soil, but\n",
      "to the fact that around the inner city, the site of which is marked by\n",
      "the mounds, there was built an outer ring of habitations at a time when\n",
      "the enclosed town of the earlier periods became too small to contain\n",
      "the growing population. The American excavations, which have been\n",
      "conducted on the site between the years 1889 and 1900, have shown that\n",
      "the earliest area of habitation was far more restricted than the mounds\n",
      "which cover the inner city.[1] In the plan on p. 88 it will be seen\n",
      "that this portion of the site is divided into two parts by the ancient\n",
      "bed of the Shatt en-NÃ®l. The contours of the mounds are indicated by\n",
      "dotted lines, and each of them bears a number in Roman figures. Mound\n",
      "III. is that which covered E-kur, the temple of Enlil, and it was\n",
      "around the shrine, in the shaded area upon the plan, that the original\n",
      "village or settlement was probably built. Here in the lowest stratum\n",
      "of the mound were found large beds of wood-ashes and animal bones, the\n",
      "remains of the earliest period of occupation.\n",

      "It is difficult to trace through all its stages the early growth of\n",
      "the city, but it would seem that the shrine in the centre of the town\n",

      "appears to agree with that in the time of NarÃ¢m-Sin as revealed by\n",
      "the excavations. In it the position of E-kur is marked at one end\n",

      "its other sides are terraces and moats. These details are incorporated\n",
      "in the accompanying plan, but their suggested relation to the remains\n",
      "uncovered in the course of the excavations is largely conjectural.\n",
      "Moreover the period in the temple's history represented by the tablet\n",
      "is not certainly established, and some of the details such as the\n",

      "appearance of the temple. In addition to building the ziggurat, he\n",
      "raised the level of the inner court above NarÃ¢m-Sin's pavement, and he\n",
      "straightened the course of the outer wall, using that of NarÃ¢m-Sin as\n",
      "a foundation where it crossed his line. His wall also included mounds\n",

      "The excavations on the site of Nippur and its temple have illustrated\n",

      "comparatively late period of Ur-Bau and Gudea. On the latter site,\n",
      "however, a number of earlier constructions have been discovered, and,\n",
      "although they are not of a purely religious character, they may well\n",

      "private dwellings, they are the only buildings of the early Sumerians\n",

      "structures upon Tell K, but it is quite possible that this was not\n",

      "Built upon a platform composed of three layers of bricks set in\n",

      "belong to the original building and were added at a later time. The\n",
      "absence of any entrance certainly proves that the building was employed\n",
      "as a storehouse.[5] Within the building are two chambers, the one\n",
      "square (A), the other of a more oblong shape (B). They were separated\n",
      "by a transverse passage or corridor (C), which also ran round inside\n",

      "The double walls were well calculated to protect the interior from damp\n",
      "or heat, and would render it more difficult for pillagers to effect an\n",
      "entrance. Both in the chambers and the passages a coating of bitumen\n",
      "was spread upon the floor and walls. Here grain, oil, and fermented\n",

      "of the manner in which the early inhabitants of Babylonia regarded\n",
      "the city-gods as the actual kings and rulers of their cities. The\n",
      "human kings and patesis were nothing more than ministers, or agents,\n",

      "the power of Kish had temporarily declined. But as the characters of\n",
      "Utug's inscription are far more archaic than those of Mesilim, we may\n",
      "provisionally set him in the period before Kish attained the rank of a\n",
      "kingdom in place of its patesiate. But how long an interval separated\n",

      "On the assumption that Utug ruled in this early period, we may see in\n",
      "the fragments of his vase from Nippur, evidence of the struggles by\n",
      "which the city of Kish attained the position of supremacy it enjoyed\n",
      "under Mesilim. For Utug's vase was not carried to Nippur as spoil from\n",
      "Kish, but was deposited by Utug himself in the temple of Enlil, in\n",
      "commemoration of a victory he had achieved over the land of Khamazi. We\n",
      "here learn the name of one of the enemies with whom Kish had to fight\n",
      "in the early stages of its existence as an independent city-state, and\n",
      "we may conjecture that many more such battles had to be fought and won\n",
      "before its influence was felt beyond the boundaries of Akkad by the\n",
      "Sumerian cities in the south. The fact that after his victory Utug\n",
      "deposited the vase at Nippur as a thank-offering proves that in his\n",
      "time the shrine of Enlil was already regarded as the central sanctuary\n",
      "of Babylonia. Zamama, the god of Kish, had achieved the victory over\n",
      "Khamazi, but Enlil, as the supreme lord of the world, was entitled\n",
      "to some recognition and gratitude, and also probably to a share of\n",
      "the spoil. From one line of the inscription upon Utug's vase we may\n",
      "perhaps infer that his father's name was Bazuzu, but, as no title\n",
      "follows the name, he is not to be reckoned as a patesi of Kish. We may\n",
      "thus conclude that Utug did not succeed his father upon the throne.\n",
      "Whether he was a usurper or succeeded some other relative, and whether\n",
      "he followed up his military successes by founding at Kish a powerful\n",
      "dynasty to which Mesilim may have belonged, are among the questions\n",
      "which may perhaps be answered as the result of future excavation in\n",
      "Northern Babylonia.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is probable that the early supremacy which Kish enjoyed during the\n",
      "reign of Mesilim continued for some time after his death. At any rate,\n",
      "the names of two other early rulers of that city are known, and, as\n",
      "they both bear the title of king, and not patesi, we may conclude that\n",
      "they lived during a period of the city's prosperity or expansion. The\n",
      "name of one of these kings, Urzage, occurs upon a broken vase of white\n",
      "calcite stalagmite, which was found at Nippur, approximately in the\n",
      "same place as the vase of the patesi Utug.[22] The inscription upon\n",
      "the vase records the fact that it was dedicated by Urzage to Enlil,\n",
      "\"king of the lands.\" and his consort Ninlil, \"the lady of heaven and\n",
      "earth.\" The end of the text is wanting, but we may conjecture that,\n",
      "like his earlier predecessor Utug, the king dedicated the vase in the\n",
      "temple of Enlil, at Nippur, in gratitude for some victory over his\n",
      "enemies. We may thus see in the dedication of the vase further evidence\n",
      "of the continued prosperity of Kish, though it is clear that it only\n",
      "maintained its position among the other great cities of the land by\n",
      "force of arms. The name of the other early king of Kish, Lugal-tarsi,\n",
      "is known to us from a short inscription upon a small tablet of\n",
      "lapis-lazuli preserved in the British Museum.[23] The text records the\n",
      "building of the wall of the enclosure, or outer court, of a temple\n",

      "also, there are no data for deciding. It will be noted that Eannatum\n",
      "calls him \"king\" of Lagash, not \"patesi,\" but the use of these titles\n",
      "by Eannatum, as applied to his predecessors, is not consistent, and,\n",
      "that he should describe Badu as \"king,\" is no proof that Badu himself\n",
      "claimed that title. But he may have done so, and we may provisionally\n",
      "place him in the interval between the patesi Lugal-shag-engur and\n",
      "Ur-NinÃ¢, who in his numerous texts that have been recovered always\n",

      "It is possible that Ur-NinÃ¢ himself, though not a great soldier, did\n",
      "something to secure, or at least to maintain, the independence of his\n",

      "inheritance from some collateral branch, or secured it as the result\n",
      "of a revolt within the city, is not recorded. It is strange that in\n",
      "none of his numerous inscriptions does he lay claim to any conquest\n",
      "or achievement in the field. Most of his texts, it is true, are of\n",

      "wealth by foreign conquest. The silence of Entemena with regard to\n",
      "the relations of Lagash to Umma at this period is not conclusive\n",
      "evidence that Mesilim's treaty was still in force, or that the peace he\n",
      "inaugurated had remained unbroken. But Entemena's silence fully accords\n",
      "with that of Ur-NinÃ¢ himself, and we may infer that, in spite of his\n",
      "claims to the royal title, he succeeded in avoiding any quarrel with\n",
      "his city's hereditary foe. Ur-NinÃ¢'s attitude towards the city-state\n",
      "upon his own immediate borders may be regarded as typical of his policy\n",
      "as a whole. The onyx bowl which he dedicated to the goddess Bau may\n",
      "possibly have been part of certain booty won in battle,[30] but his\n",
      "aim appears to have been to devote his energies to the improvement of\n",
      "his land and the adornment of his city. It is therefore natural that\n",
      "his inscriptions[31] should consist of mere catalogues of the names of\n",
      "temples and other buildings erected during his reign, together with\n",
      "lists of the statues he dedicated to his gods, and of the canals he cut\n",
      "in order to increase the material wealth of his people.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, while Ur-NinÃ¢'s policy appears to have been mainly of a domestic\n",
      "character, he did not fail to maintain relations with other cities\n",
      "in the sphere of religious observance. That he should have continued\n",
      "in active communication with Nippur, as the religious centre of the\n",
      "whole of Babylonia, is what we might infer from the practice of the\n",
      "period, and we may probably trace to this fact his dedication to Enlil\n",
      "of one of the canals which was cut during his reign. A more striking\n",
      "instance of the deference paid by Ur-NinÃ¢ to the god of another city\n",
      "may be seen in his relations to Enki, the Sumerian prototype of the\n",
      "god Ea. When Ur-NinÃ¢ planned the rebuilding of the temple E-ninnÃ», he\n",
      "appears to have taken precautions to ensure the success of his scheme\n",
      "by making a direct appeal to Enki, the city-god of Eridu. On a diorite\n",
      "plaque that has been found at Tello[32] he records the delivery of his\n",
      "prayer to Enki, that in his character of Chief Diviner he should use\n",
      "his pure reed, the wand of his divination, to render the work good and\n",
      "should pronounce a favourable oracle. The temple of Enki in the city\n",
      "of Eridu, near the shore of the Persian Gulf, was one of the earliest\n",
      "and most sacred of Sumerian shrines, and we may perhaps picture Ur-NinÃ¢\n",
      "as journeying thither from Lagash, in order to carry his petition in\n",
      "person into the presence of its mysterious god.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the deities of Lagash to whose service Ur-NinÃ¢ appears especially\n",
      "to have devoted himself, the goddess NinÃ¢, whose name he bore within\n",
      "his own, was one of the most favoured. For one of the chief claims to\n",
      "distinction that he puts forward is that he built her temple at Lagash;\n",
      "and although, unlike the later great builder Gudea, he gives in his\n",
      "inscriptions few details of his work, we may conclude that he lavished\n",
      "his resources upon it. He also boasts that he made a statue of NinÃ¢,\n",
      "which he no doubt set up within her temple, and one of his canals he\n",
      "dedicated to her. Her daughter Ninmar was not neglected, for he records\n",
      "that he built her temple also, and he erected a temple for Gatumdug,\n",
      "NinÃ¢'s intercessor, and fashioned a statue of her. Another group of\n",
      "Ur-NinÃ¢'s buildings was connected with the worship of Ningirsu, the\n",
      "city-god of Lagash, whose claims a ruler, so devoted to the interests\n",
      "of his own city as Ur-NinÃ¢, would naturally not have ignored.\n",
      "\n",
      "A glance at his texts will show that Ur-NinÃ¢ more than once describes\n",
      "himself as the builder of \"the House of Girsu,\" a title by which he\n",
      "refers to E-ninnÃ», the great temple dedicated to Ningirsu, since it\n",
      "stood in that quarter of the city which was named Girsu and was by\n",
      "far its most important building.[33] He also built E-pa, a sanctuary\n",
      "closely connected with E-ninnÃ» and the worship of Ningirsu. This temple\n",
      "was added to at a later date by Gudea, who installed therein his\n",
      "patron god, Ningishzida, and set the nuptial gifts of Bau, Ningirsu's\n",
      "consort, within its shrine; it is possible that Ur-NinÃ¢'s onyx bowl,\n",
      "which was dedicated to Bau, and the fragments of other bowls found\n",
      "with it,[34] were deposited by Ur-NinÃ¢ in the same temple. Of other\n",
      "deities in Ningirsu's entourage, whom Ur-NinÃ¢ singled out for special\n",
      "veneration, may be mentioned Dunshagga, Ningirsu's son, and Uri-zi, the\n",
      "god whose duty it was to look after Ningirsu's _harÃ®m_. Among lesser\n",
      "temples, or portions of temples, which were built or restored by him\n",
      "was the Tirash, where on the day of the New Moon's appearance it was\n",
      "the custom to hold a festival in honour of Ningirsu; while another act\n",
      "of piety which Ur-NinÃ¢ records was the making of a statue of Lugal-uru,\n",
      "the god from whose festival one of the Sumerian months took its name.\n",
      "In this connection, mention may also be made of the god Dun-...,[35]\n",
      "whom Ur-NinÃ¢ describes as the \"God-king,\" since he stood in a peculiar\n",
      "relation to Ur-NinÃ¢ and his family. He became the patron deity of the\n",
      "dynasty which Ur-NinÃ¢ founded, and, down to the reign of Enannatum II.,\n",
      "was the personal protector of the reigning king or patesi of Lagash.[36]\n",
      "\n",
      "For the construction of his temples Ur-NinÃ¢ states that he fetched\n",
      "wood from the mountains, but unlike Gudea in a later age, he is not\n",
      "recorded to have brought in his craftsmen from abroad. In addition\n",
      "to the building of temples, Ur-NinÃ¢'s other main activity appears\n",
      "to have centred in the cutting of canals; among these was the canal\n",
      "named Asukhur, on the banks of which his grandson Eannatum won a\n",
      "battle. That the changes he introduced into the canalization of the\n",
      "country were entirely successful may be inferred from the numerous\n",
      "storehouses and magazines, which he records he built in connection\n",
      "with the various temples,[37] and by his statement that when he added\n",
      "to the temple of Ningirsu he stored up large quantities of grain\n",
      "within the temple-granaries. In fact, from the inscriptions he has\n",
      "left us, Ur-NinÃ¢ appears as a pacific monarch devoted to the worship\n",
      "of his city-gods and to the welfare of his own people. His ambitions\n",
      "lay within his own borders, and, when he had secured his frontier, he\n",
      "was content to practise the arts of peace. It was doubtless due to\n",
      "this wise and far-seeing policy that the resources of the city were\n",
      "husbanded, so that under his more famous grandson she was enabled\n",
      "to repel the attack of enemies and embark upon a career of foreign\n",
      "conquest. Ur-NinÃ¢'s posthumous fame is evidence that his reign was a\n",
      "period of peace and prosperity for Lagash. His great-grandson Entemena\n",
      "boasts of being his descendant, and ascribes to him the title of King\n",
      "of Lagash which he did not claim either for himself or for his father\n",

      "We are not dependent solely on what we can gather from the inscriptions\n",
      "themselves for a knowledge of Ur-NinÃ¢. For he has left us sculptured\n",

      "principal officers, from which we may form a very clear picture of the\n",
      "primitive conditions of life obtaining in Sumer at the time of this\n",

      "and his court.[39] The plaques are oblong in shape, with the corners\n",
      "slightly rounded, and in the centre of each is bored a circular hole.\n",
      "Though they are obviously of a votive character, the exact object for\n",
      "which they are intended is not clear at first sight. It has been, and\n",
      "indeed is still, conjectured that the plaques were fixed vertically to\n",

      "Ningirsu during the reign of Entemena. From the shape of the latter,\n",
      "the reverse of which is not flat but pyramidal, and also from the\n",

      "or sacred emblems, which were dedicated as votive offerings in the\n",

      "will show that there is little to be said for it, and it is probable\n",
      "that the slight difference in the height of the figures is fortuitous\n",
      "and unconnected with their respective ages. It may be admitted that a\n",
      "good deal depends upon the sex of Lidda, who, on the largest plaque,\n",
      "faces the standing figure of Ur-NinÃ¢. If this is intended for a son of\n",

      "That the crown-prince should be here represented as attending his\n",
      "sister may appear strange, but, in view of our imperfect knowledge\n",
      "of this early period, the suggestion should not be dismissed solely\n",
      "on that account. Indeed, the class of temple votaries, who enjoyed\n",
      "a high social position under the Semitic kings of the First Dynasty\n",
      "of Babylon, probably had its counterpart at the centres of Sumerian\n",
      "worship in still earlier times; and there is evidence that at the time\n",
      "of the First Dynasty, the order included members of the royal house.\n",
      "Moreover, tablets dating from the close of Ur-NinÃ¢'s dynasty show the\n",
      "important part which women played in the social and official life of\n",
      "the early Sumerians.[50] Thus it is possible that Ur-NinÃ¢'s daughter\n",
      "held high rank or office in the temple hierarchy, and her presence\n",
      "on the plaque may have reference to some special ceremony, or act of\n",
      "dedication, in which it was her privilege to take the leading part\n",
      "after the king, or to be his chief assistant. In such circumstances it\n",
      "would not be unnatural for her eldest brother to attend her. In both\n",

      "of honour. In the one he stands on a line with the king immediately\n",
      "behind the royal cup-bearer, and he is the only royal son who is\n",
      "specifically labelled as such; in the other he is again on a line with\n",
      "the king, separated from Anita, the cup-bearer, by a high officer of\n",
      "state, and followed by the royal scribe. In these scenes he is clearly\n",

      "the crown-prince, it would be hard to explain the latter's absence,\n",
      "except on the supposition that his death had occurred before the\n",

      "the building of Ningirsu's temple, and they thus appear to have been\n",
      "prepared for the same occasion, which gives additional weight to the\n",

      "may be reconciled on the supposition either that the conflict in\n",
      "the reign of Akurgal was of no great importance, or that it did not\n",
      "concern the fertile plain of Gu-edin. It must be remembered that the\n",
      "text upon the Cone of Entemena was composed after the stirring times\n",
      "of Eannatum, Entemena's uncle, and the successes won by that monarch\n",
      "against Umma were naturally of far greater importance in his eyes than\n",
      "the lesser conflicts of his predecessors. It is true that he describes\n",
      "the still earlier intervention of Mesilim in the affairs of Lagash\n",
      "and Umma, but this is because the actual stele or boundary-stone set\n",
      "up by Mesilim was removed by the men of Umma in Eannatum's reign, an\n",
      "act which provoked the war. The story of Mesilim's intervention, which\n",
      "resulted in the setting up of the boundary-stone, thus forms a natural\n",
      "introduction to the record of Eannatum's campaign; and the fact that\n",
      "these two events closely follow one another in Entemena's text is not\n",
      "inconsistent with a less important conflict being recorded by the Stele\n",
      "of the Vultures as having taken place in the reign of Akurgal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only other evidence with regard to the achievements of Akurgal\n",
      "is furnished by the titles ascribed to him by his two sons. Upon\n",
      "the Stele of the Vultures,[54] Eannatum describes him as \"king\" of\n",
      "Lagash, and from this passage alone it might be inferred that he was\n",
      "as successful as his father Ur-NinÃ¢ in maintaining the independence\n",
      "of his city. But in other texts upon foundation-stones, bricks, and a\n",
      "small column, Eannatum describes him only as \"patesi,\" as also does\n",
      "his other son Enannatum I. It should be noted that in the majority\n",
      "of his inscriptions Eannatum claims for himself the title of patesi,\n",
      "and at the end of one of them, in which he has enumerated a long list\n",
      "of his own conquests, he exclaims, \"He (_i.e._ Eannatum) is the son\n",
      "of Akurgal, the patesi of Lagash, and his grandfather is Ur-NinÃ¢,\n",
      "the patesi of Lagash.\"[55] That he should term Ur-NinÃ¢ \"patesi\" does\n",
      "not accord with that ruler's own texts, but, if Eannatum himself had\n",
      "been merely a patesi at the beginning of his reign, and his father\n",
      "had also been one before him, he may well have overlooked the more\n",
      "ambitious title to which his grandfather had laid claim, especially\n",
      "as this omission would enhance the splendour of his own achievements.\n",
      "It is also possible that at this time the distinction between the two\n",
      "titles was not so strictly drawn as in the later periods, and that\n",
      "an alteration in them did not always mark a corresponding political\n",
      "change.[56] However this may be, the subsequent conflicts of Eannatum\n",
      "suggest that Lagash had failed to maintain her freedom. We may assume\n",
      "that the North had once more interfered in the affairs of Sumer, and\n",
      "that Kish had put an end to the comparative independence which the city\n",
      "had enjoyed during Ur-NinÃ¢'s reign.\n",

      "WARS OF THE CITY-STATES; EANNATUM AND THE STELE OF THE VULTURES\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When the patesiate of Lagash passed from Akurgal to his son Eannatum\n",
      "we may picture the city-state as owing a general allegiance to Akkad\n",
      "in the north. Nearer home, the relations of Lagash to Umma appear to\n",
      "have been of an amicable character. Whatever minor conflicts may have\n",
      "taken place between the two cities in the interval, the treaty of\n",
      "Mesilim was still regarded as binding, and its terms were treated with\n",
      "respect by both parties. The question whether Eannatum, like Akurgal,\n",
      "had had some minor cause of disagreement with the men of Umma at the\n",
      "beginning of his reign depends upon our interpretation of some broken\n",
      "passages in the early part of the text engraved upon the Stele of the\n",
      "Vultures.[1] The second column deals with the relations of Umma and\n",
      "Lagash during the reign of Akurgal, and the fourth column concerns the\n",
      "reign of Eannatum. The name of neither of these rulers is mentioned\n",
      "in the intermediate portion of the text, which, however, refers to\n",
      "Umma and Lagash in connection with a shrine or chapel dedicated to the\n",
      "god Ningirsu. It is possible that we have here a continuation of the\n",
      "narrative of the preceding column, and in that case we should assign\n",
      "this portion of the text to the reign of Akurgal, rather than to the\n",
      "early part of the reign of his successor. But it may equally well refer\n",
      "to Eannatum's own reign, and may either record a minor cause of dispute\n",
      "between the cities which was settled before the outbreak of the great\n",
      "war, or may perhaps be taken in connection with the following columns\n",
      "of the text.\n",
      "\n",
      "These two columns definitely refer to Eannatum's reign and describe\n",
      "certain acts of piety which he performed in the service of his gods.\n",
      "They record work carried out in E-ninnÃ», by which the heart of\n",
      "Ningirsu was rejoiced; the naming and dedication of some portion of\n",
      "E-anna, the temple of the goddess Ninni; and certain additions made\n",
      "to the sacred flocks of the goddess Ninkharsag. The repetition of the\n",
      "phrase referring to Ninni's temple[2] suggests a disconnected list\n",
      "of Eannatum's achievements in the service of his gods, rather than a\n",
      "connected narrative. The text in the fifth column continues the record\n",
      "of the benefits bestowed by him upon Ningirsu, and here we may perhaps\n",
      "trace a possible cause of the renewal of the war with Umma. For the\n",
      "text states that Eannatum bestowed certain territory upon Ningirsu and\n",
      "rejoiced his heart; and, unless this refers to land occupied after\n",
      "the defeat of Umma, its acquisition may have been resented by the\n",
      "neighbouring city. Such an incident would have formed ample excuse for\n",
      "the invasion of the territory of Lagash by the injured party, though,\n",
      "according to the records of Eannatum himself and of Entemena, it would\n",
      "appear that the raid of the men of Umma was unprovoked. But, whatever\n",
      "may have been the immediate cause of the outbreak of hostilities, we\n",
      "shall see reason for believing that the war was ultimately due to the\n",
      "influence of Kish.\n",
      "\n",
      "The outbreak of the war between Umma and Lagash is recorded concisely\n",
      "in the sixth column of the inscription upon the Stele of the Vultures,\n",
      "which states that the patesi of Umma, by the command of his god,\n",
      "plundered[3] Gu-edin, the territory beloved of Ningirsu. In this\n",
      "record, brief as it is, it is interesting to note that the patesi of\n",
      "Umma is regarded as no more than the instrument of his city-god, or\n",
      "the minister who carries out his commands. As the gods in a former\n",
      "generation had drawn up the treaty between Lagash and Umma, which\n",
      "Mesilim, their suzerain, had at the command of his own goddess engraved\n",
      "upon the stele of delimitation, so now it was the god, and not the\n",
      "patesi, of Umma, who repudiated the terms of that treaty by sending\n",
      "his army across the border. Gu-edin, too, is described, not in its\n",
      "relation to the patesi of Lagash, but as the special property of\n",
      "Ningirsu, the opposing city-god. We shall see presently that Eannatum's\n",
      "first act, on hearing news of the invasion, was quite in harmony with\n",
      "the theocratic feeling of the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patesi who led the forces of Umma is not named by Eannatum upon the\n",
      "Stele of the Vultures, but from the Cone of Entemena[4] we learn that\n",
      "his name was Ush. In the summary of events which is given upon that\n",
      "document it is stated that Ush, patesi of Umma, acted with ambitious\n",
      "designs, and that, having removed the stele of delimitation which had\n",
      "been set up in an earlier age by Mesilim between the territories of the\n",
      "respective states, he invaded the plain of Lagash. The pitched battle\n",
      "between the forces of Umma and Lagash, which followed the raid into the\n",
      "latter's territory, is recorded by Entemena in equally brief terms. The\n",
      "battle is said to have taken place at the word of Ningirsu, the warrior\n",
      "of Enlil, and the destruction of the men of Umma is ascribed not only\n",
      "to the command, but also to the actual agency, of Enlil himself. Here,\n",
      "again, we find Enlil, the god of the central cult of Nippur, recognized\n",
      "as the supreme arbiter of human and divine affairs. The various\n",
      "city-gods might make war on one another, but it was Enlil who decreed\n",
      "to which side victory should incline.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the record of the war which Eannatum himself has left us, we are\n",
      "furnished with details of a more striking character than those given\n",
      "in Entemena's brief summary. In the latter it is recorded that the\n",
      "battle was waged at the word of Ningirsu, and the Stele of the Vultures\n",
      "amplifies this bald statement by describing the circumstances which\n",
      "attended the notification of the divine will. On learning of the\n",
      "violation of his border by the men of Umma and the plundering of his\n",
      "territory which had ensued, Eannatum did not at once summon his troops\n",
      "and lead them in pursuit of the enemy. There was indeed little danger\n",
      "in delay, and no advantage to be gained by immediate action. For Umma,\n",
      "from its proximity to Lagash, afforded a haven for the plunderers\n",
      "which they could reach in safety before the forces of Lagash could be\n",
      "called to arms. Thus Eannatum had no object in hurrying out his army,\n",
      "when there was little chance of overtaking the enemy weighed down with\n",
      "spoil. Moreover, all the damage that could be done to Gu-edin had no\n",
      "doubt been done thoroughly by the men of Umma. In addition to carrying\n",
      "off Mesilim's stele, they had probably denuded the pastures of all\n",
      "flocks and cattle, had trampled the crops, and had sacked and burnt\n",
      "the villages and hamlets through which they had passed. When once\n",
      "they and their plunder were safe within their own border, they were\n",
      "not likely to repeat the raid at once. They might be expected to take\n",
      "action to protect their own territory, but the next move obviously lay\n",
      "with Lagash. In these circumstances Eannatum had no object in attacking\n",
      "before his army was ready for the field, and his preparations for war\n",
      "had been completed; and while the streets of Lagash were doubtless\n",
      "re-echoing with the blows of the armourers and the tramp of armed men,\n",
      "the city-gates must have been thronged with eager groups of citizens,\n",
      "awaiting impatiently the return of scouts sent out after the retreating\n",
      "foe. Meanwhile, we may picture Eannatum repairing to the temple of\n",
      "Ningirsu, where, having laid his complaint before him, he awaited the\n",
      "god's decision as to the course his patesi and his people should follow\n",

      "remained in place, it would serve as a final authority to which appeal\n",

      "made up the territory known by the general name of Gu-edin, or perhaps\n",
      "formed an addition to that territory, the cession of which Eannatum may\n",
      "have exacted from Umma as part of the terms of peace. While consenting\n",
      "to the restoration of the disputed territory, and the rectification\n",
      "of the frontier, Umma was also obliged to pay as tribute to Lagash a\n",

      "other rites in her honour at Kesh, and turning again to the goddess, he\n",

      "time they shall alter this word, may the great net of Ninkharsag, by\n",
      "whom they have sworn the oath, strike Umma down!\" Enki, the god of the\n",
      "abyss of waters beneath the earth, is the next deity to be invoked,\n",
      "and before him Eannatum records that he presented certain fish as\n",
      "offerings; his net Eannatum has cast over the men of Umma, and should\n",
      "they cross the ditch, he prays that destruction may come upon Umma by\n",
      "its means. Enzu, the Moon-god of Ur, whom Eannatum describes as \"the\n",
      "strong bull-calf of Enlil,\" is then addressed; four doves were set as\n",
      "offerings before him, and he is invoked to destroy Umma with his net,\n",
      "should the men of that city ever cross Ningirsu's boundary, or alter\n",
      "the course of the ditch, or carry away the stele of delimitation.\n",
      "Before Babbar, the Sun-god, in his city of Larsa, Eannatum states that\n",
      "he has offered bulls as offerings, and his great net, which he has cast\n",
      "over the men of Umma, is invoked in similar terms. Finally, Eannatum\n",
      "prays to Ninki, by whom the oath has also been taken, to punish any\n",

      "The great stele of Eannatum, from the text upon which we have taken\n",
      "much of the description of his war with Umma, is the most striking\n",
      "example of early Sumerian art that has come down to us, and the\n",
      "sculptures upon it throw considerable light upon the customs and\n",
      "beliefs of this primitive race. The metaphor of the net, for example,\n",
      "which is employed by Eannatum throughout the curses he calls down\n",
      "upon Umma, in the event of any violation of the treaty, is strikingly\n",
      "illustrated by a scene sculptured upon two of the fragments of the\n",
      "stele which have been recovered. When complete, the stele consisted of\n",
      "a large slab of stone, curved at the top, and it was sculptured and\n",
      "inscribed upon both sides and also upon its edges. Up to the present\n",
      "time seven fragments of it have been recovered during the course of\n",
      "the excavations at Tello, of which six are in the Louvre and one is\n",
      "in the British Museum; these are usually distinguished by the symbols\n",
      "A to G.[12] Although the fragments thus recovered represent but a\n",
      "small proportion of the original monument, it is possible from a\n",
      "careful study of them to form a fairly complete idea of the scenes\n",
      "that were sculptured upon it. As we have already noted, the monument\n",
      "was a stele of victory set up by Eannatum, and the two faces of\n",
      "the slab are sculptured in low relief with scenes illustrating the\n",
      "victory, but differing considerably in character. On the face the\n",
      "representations are mythological and religious, while on the back they\n",
      "are historical. It might very naturally be supposed that the face of\n",
      "the stele would have been occupied by representations of Eannatum\n",
      "himself triumphing over his enemies, and, until the text upon the\n",
      "stele was thoroughly deciphered and explained, this was indeed the\n",
      "accepted opinion. But it is now clear that Eannatum devoted the front\n",
      "of the stele to representations of his gods, while the reverse of the\n",
      "monument was considered the appropriate place for the scenes depicting\n",
      "the patesi and his army carrying out the divine will. The arrangement\n",
      "of the reliefs upon the stone thus forcibly illustrates the belief of\n",
      "this early period that the god of the city was its real ruler, whose\n",
      "minister and servant the patesi was, not merely in metaphor, but in\n",
      "actual fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon the largest portion of the stele that has been recovered,\n",
      "formed of two fragments joined together,[13] we have the scene which\n",
      "illustrates Eannatum's metaphor of the net. Almost the whole of this\n",
      "portion of the monument is occupied with the figure of a god, which\n",
      "appears of colossal size if it is compared with those of the patesi and\n",
      "his soldiers upon the reverse of the stele. The god has flowing hair,\n",
      "bound with a double fillet, and, while cheeks and lips are shaved,\n",
      "a long beard falls in five undulating curls from the chin upon the\n",
      "breast. He is nude to the waist, around which he wears a close-fitting\n",
      "garment with two folds in front indicated by double lines. It was at\n",
      "first suggested that we should see in this figure a representation\n",
      "of some early hero, such as Gilgamesh, but there is no doubt that we\n",
      "should identify him with Ningirsu, the city-god of Lagash. For in his\n",
      "right hand the god holds the emblem of Lagash, the eagle with outspread\n",
      "wings, clawing the heads of two lions; and the stele itself, while\n",
      "indirectly perpetuating Eannatum's fame, was essentially intended to\n",
      "commemorate victories achieved by Ningirsu over his city's enemies.\n",
      "This fact will also explain the rest of the scene sculptured upon the\n",
      "lower fragment. For the god grasps in his right hand a heavy mace,\n",
      "which he lets fall upon a net in front of him containing captive\n",
      "foes, whose bodies may be seen between its broad meshes struggling\n",
      "and writhing within it. On the relief the cords of the net are\n",
      "symmetrically arranged, and it apparently rises as a solid structure\n",
      "to the level of the god's waist. It thus has the appearance of a cage\n",
      "with cross-bars and supports of wood or metal. But the rounded corners\n",
      "at the top indicate that we may regard it as a net formed of ropes and\n",
      "cordage. That it should rise stiffly before the god may be partly due\n",
      "to the imperfect knowledge of perspective characteristic of all early\n",
      "art, partly perhaps to the desire of the sculptor to allow the emblem\n",
      "of Lagash, grasped in the god's left hand, to rest upon it; unless\n",
      "indeed the emblem itself is a part of the net, by means of which the\n",
      "god is holding it up. In any case the proximity of the emblem to the\n",
      "net is not fortuitous. Within the net are the foes of Lagash, and with\n",
      "the mace in his right hand Ningirsu is represented as clubbing the head\n",

      "doubt that it represents the forepart of a chariot. We have the same\n",
      "curved front which is seen in the chariot of Eannatum upon the reverse\n",
      "of the stele, and the same arrangement of the reins which pass through\n",
      "a double ring fixed in the front of the chariot and are hitched over\n",
      "a high support. Here the support and the front of the chariot are\n",
      "decorated with a form of the emblem of Lagash, the spread eagle and\n",
      "the lions, and we may therefore conclude that the chariot is that of\n",
      "Ningirsu; indeed, on the left of the fragment a part of the god's plain\n",
      "garment may be detected, similar to that which he wears in the upper\n",
      "register. He is evidently standing in the chariot, and we may picture\n",
      "him riding in triumph after the destruction of his foes.\n",
      "\n",
      "A close analogy may thus be traced between the two scenes upon the\n",
      "front of the stele and the two upper registers upon the back. In the\n",
      "latter we have representations of Eannatum on foot leading his warriors\n",
      "to battle, and also riding victoriously in a chariot at their head.\n",
      "On the front of the stele are scenes of a similar character in the\n",
      "religious sphere, representing Ningirsu slaying the enemies of Lagash,\n",
      "and afterwards riding in his chariot in triumph. It may also be noted\n",
      "that the composition of the scenes in the two registers upon the face\n",
      "of the stone is admirably planned. In the upper register the colossal\n",
      "figure of Ningirsu with his net, upon the right, is balanced below on\n",
      "the left by his figure in the chariot; and, similarly, the smaller\n",
      "figure or figures above were balanced by the ass that drew Ningirsu's\n",
      "chariot, and the small figure of a goddess who faces him.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are few indications to enable us to identify the goddesses who\n",
      "accompany Ningirsu. If the figures in both registers represent the same\n",
      "divine personage the names of several goddesses suggest themselves. We\n",
      "might, perhaps, see in her Ningirsu's wife Bau, the daughter of Anu, or\n",
      "his sister NinÃ¢, the goddess of the oracle, to whose service Eannatum\n",
      "was specially devoted, or Gatumdug, the mother of Lagash. But the\n",
      "military standard which accompanies the goddess in the upper scene, and\n",
      "the ends of two darts or javelins which appear in the same fragment\n",
      "to rise from, or be bound upon, her shoulders, seem to show that the\n",
      "upper goddess, at any rate, is of a warlike character. Moreover, in\n",
      "another inscription, Eannatum ascribes a success he has achieved in war\n",
      "to the direct intervention of the goddess Ninni,[19] proving that she,\n",
      "like the later Babylonian and Assyrian goddess Ishtar, was essentially\n",
      "the goddess of battle. It is permissible, therefore, to see in the\n",
      "upper goddess, sculptured upon the face of the Stele of the Vultures,\n",
      "a representation of Ninni, the goddess of battle, who attends the\n",
      "city-god Ningirsu while he is engaged in the slaughter of his foes. In\n",
      "the lower register it is possible we have a second representation of\n",
      "Ninni, where she appears to welcome Ningirsu after the slaughter is at\n",
      "an end. But though the headdresses of the two goddesses are identical,\n",
      "the accompanying emblems appear to differ, and we are thus justified in\n",
      "suggesting for the lower figure some goddess other than Ninni, whose\n",
      "work was finished when Ningirsu had secured the victory. The deity most\n",
      "fitted to gladden Ningirsu's sight on his return would have been his\n",
      "faithful wife Bau, who was wont to recline beside her lord upon his\n",
      "couch within the temple E-ninnÃ». We may thus provisionally identify the\n",
      "goddess of the lower register with Bau, who is there portrayed going\n",
      "out to meet the chariot of her lord and master upon his return from\n",
      "battle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the scenes which are sculptured upon the back of the Stele of\n",
      "the Vultures are of even greater interest than those upon its face,\n",
      "since they afford us a picture of these early Sumerian peoples as they\n",
      "appeared when engaged in the continual wars which were waged between\n",
      "the various city-states. Like the scenes upon the face of the stele,\n",
      "those upon the back are arranged in separate registers, divided one\n",
      "from the other by raised bands, or fillets, stretching across the face\n",
      "of the monument and representing the soil on which the scenes portrayed\n",
      "above them took place. The registers upon the back are smaller than\n",
      "those on the face, being at least four in number, in place of the\n",
      "two scenes which are devoted to Ningirsu and his attendant deities.\n",
      "As might be expected, the scenes upon the back of the stele are on a\n",
      "smaller scale than those upon the face, and the number and variety of\n",
      "the figures composing them are far greater. Little space has been left\n",
      "on the reverse of the stone for the inscription, the greater part of\n",
      "which is engraved on the front of the monument, in the broad spaces\n",
      "of the field between the divine figures. Of the highest of the four\n",
      "registers upon the reverse four fragments have been recovered,[20] one\n",
      "of which (A) proves that the curved head of the stele on this side\n",
      "was filled with the representations of vultures, to which reference\n",
      "has already been made.[21] The intention of the sculptor was clearly\n",
      "to represent them as flying thick in the air overhead, bearing off\n",
      "from the field of battle the severed heads and limbs of the slain.\n",
      "The birds thus formed a very decorative and striking feature of the\n",
      "monument, and the popular name of the stele, which is derived from\n",
      "them, is fully justified. In the same register on the left is a scene\n",
      "representing Eannatum leading his troops in battle.[22] and we there\n",
      "see them advancing over the bodies of the slain; while from the extreme\n",
      "right of the same register we have a fragment representing men engaged\n",
      "in collecting the dead and piling them in heaps for burial.[23] We may\n",
      "conjecture that the central portion of the register, which is missing,\n",
      "portrayed the enemies of Eannatum falling before his lance. In the\n",
      "register immediately below we find another representation of Eannatum\n",
      "at the head of his troops. Here, however, they are not in battle array\n",
      "but on the march, and Eannatum, instead of advancing on foot, is riding\n",
      "before them in his chariot.[24]\n",
      "\n",
      "The sculptured representations of Eannatum and his soldiers, which\n",
      "are preserved upon these fragments, are of the greatest importance,\n",
      "for they give a vivid picture of the Sumerian method of fighting,\n",
      "and supply detailed information with regard to the arms and armour\n",
      "in use at this early period. We note that the Sumerians advanced to\n",
      "the attack in a solid phalanx, the leading rank being protected by\n",
      "huge shields or bucklers that covered the whole body from the neck to\n",
      "the feet, and were so broad that, when lined up in battle array, only\n",
      "enough space was left for a lance to be levelled between each; the\n",
      "lance-bearers carried as an additional weapon an axe, resembling an\n",
      "adze with a flat head. From the second register, in which we see the\n",
      "army on the march, it is clear that no shield was carried by the rank\n",
      "and file for individual protection; the huge bucklers were only borne\n",
      "by men in the front rank, and they thus served to protect the whole\n",
      "front of an attacking force as it advanced in solid formation. In the\n",
      "scene in the upper register two soldiers are sculptured behind each\n",
      "shield, and in each gap between the shields six lances are levelled\n",
      "which are grasped firmly in both hands by the soldiers wielding them.\n",
      "The massing of the lances in this fashion is obviously a device of the\n",
      "sculptor to suggest six rows of soldiers advancing one behind the other\n",
      "to the attack. But the fact that each lance is represented as grasped\n",
      "in both hands by its owner proves that the shields were not carried by\n",
      "the lance-bearers themselves, but by soldiers stationed in the front,\n",
      "armed only with an axe. The sole duty of a shield-bearer during an\n",
      "attack in phalanx was clearly to keep his shield in position, which was\n",
      "broad enough to protect his own body and that of the lance-bearer on\n",
      "his right. Thus the representation of two soldiers behind each buckler\n",
      "on the Stele of the Vultures is a perfectly accurate detail. As soon\n",
      "as an attack had been successfully delivered, and the enemy was in\n",
      "flight, the shield-bearers could discard the heavy shields they carried\n",
      "and join in the pursuit. The light axe with which they were armed was\n",
      "admirably suited for hand-to-hand conflicts, and it is probable that\n",
      "the lance-bearers themselves abandoned their heavy weapons and had\n",
      "recourse to the axe when they broke their close formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both Eannatum and his soldiers wear a conical helmet, covering the\n",
      "brow and carried down low at the back so as to protect the neck, the\n",
      "royal helmet being distinguished by the addition at the sides of\n",
      "moulded pieces to protect the ears. Both the shields and the helmets\n",
      "were probably of leather, though the nine circular bosses on the face\n",
      "of each of the former may possibly have been of metal. Their use was\n",
      "clearly to strengthen the shields, and they were probably attached to\n",
      "a wooden framework on the other side. They would also tend to protect\n",
      "the surface of the shields by deflecting blows aimed at them. The royal\n",
      "weapons consisted of a long lance or spear, wielded in the left hand,\n",
      "and a curved mace or throwing-stick, formed of three strands bound\n",
      "together at intervals with thongs of leather or bands of metal. When\n",
      "in his chariot on the march, the king was furnished with additional\n",
      "weapons, consisting of a flat-headed axe like those of his soldiers,\n",
      "and a number of light darts, some fitted with double points. These last\n",
      "he carried in a huge quiver attached to the fore part of his chariot,\n",
      "and with them we may note a double-thonged whip, doubtless intended for\n",
      "driving the ass or asses that drew the vehicle. It is probable that the\n",
      "soldiers following Eannatum in both scenes were picked men, who formed\n",
      "the royal body-guard, for those in the battle-scene are distinguished\n",
      "by the long hair or, rather, wig, that falls upon their shoulders\n",
      "from beneath their helmets,[25] and those on the march are seen to be\n",
      "clothed from the waist downwards in the rough woollen garment similar\n",
      "to that worn by the king. They may well have been recruited among\n",
      "the members of the royal house and the chief families of Lagash. The\n",
      "king's apparel is distinguished from theirs by the addition of a cloak,\n",
      "possibly of skin,[26] worn over the left shoulder in such a way that it\n",
      "leaves the right arm and shoulder entirely free.\n",

      "Considerable light is thrown upon the burial customs of the Sumerians\n",
      "by the scene sculptured in the third register, or section, on the\n",
      "reverse of the stele of Eannatum. Portions of the scene are preserved\n",
      "upon the fragments C and F, which we have already noted may be\n",
      "connected with each other by means of the fragment G, preserved in\n",
      "the British Museum. In this register we have a representation of the\n",
      "scenes following the victory of Eannatum, when the king and his army\n",
      "had time to collect their dead and bury them with solemn rites and\n",
      "sacrifices beneath huge tells or burial-mounds. It will be remembered\n",
      "that a fragment of the top register portrays the collection of the\n",
      "dead upon the battlefield; here, on the left, we see the mounds in\n",
      "course of construction, under which the dead were buried.[27] The dead\n",
      "are quite nude, and are seen to be piled up in rows, head to head and\n",
      "feet to feet alternately. The two corpses at the base are sculptured\n",
      "lying flat upon the ground, and, as the tell rises, they appear to\n",
      "be arranged like the sticks of a fan. This arrangement was doubtless\n",
      "due to the sculptor's necessity of filling the semi-circular head of\n",
      "the tell, and does not represent the manner in which the corpses were\n",
      "actually arranged for burial. We may conclude that they were set out\n",
      "symmetrically in double rows, and that the position of every one was\n",
      "horizontal, additional rows being added until sufficient height had\n",

      "Umma would be the most important, and its record, copied directly\n",
      "from the text of the treaty, would still occupy three quarters of the\n",
      "stone. Moreover, we should have to suppose that the scribe slavishly\n",
      "copied the text of the stele of delimitation even down to its title,\n",
      "and made no attempt to assimilate with it the later records, which\n",
      "we must assume he added in the form of additional paragraphs. Such a\n",
      "supposition is extremely unlikely, and it is preferable to regard the\n",

      "registers other than those of which we already possess fragments, and\n",
      "the conception and arrangement of the reliefs gains immensely in unity\n",
      "and coherence. On the obverse we have only two registers, the upper one\n",
      "rather larger than the one below, and both devoted, as we have seen, to\n",

      "Eannatum, who is seen leading his troops to the attack, returning in\n",
      "his chariot from the field of battle, performing funeral rites for his\n",
      "dead soldiers, and deciding the fate of captives he has taken. Thus the\n",
      "reliefs admirably illustrate the description of the war with Umma, and\n",
      "we may conclude that the Stele of the Vultures was either the actual\n",
      "stele of delimitation set up by Eannatum upon the frontier, or, as is\n",
      "more probable, an exact copy of its text, embellished with sculptures,\n",
      "upon a stone which Eannatum caused to be carved and set up within\n",
      "his own city as a memorial of his conquest. Indeed, we may perhaps\n",
      "make the further assumption that the stele was erected within the\n",
      "temple of Ningirsu, since it commemorates the recovery of Gu-edin, the\n",
      "territory that was peculiarly his own. The Stele of the Vultures, with\n",
      "its elaborate and delicate relief, would have been out of place upon\n",
      "the frontier of Gu-edin, where, we may conjecture, the memorial stone\n",
      "would have been made as strong and plain as possible, so as to offer\n",
      "little scope for mutilation. But, if destined to be set up within the\n",
      "shelter of Ningirsu's temple in Lagash, the sculptor would have had no\n",
      "restriction placed upon his efforts; and the prominent place assigned\n",
      "to Ningirsu in the reliefs, upon the face of the memorial, is fully in\n",
      "keeping with the suggestion that the Stele of the Vultures at one time\n",
      "stood within his shrine.\n",
      "\n",
      "In favour of the view that the monument was not the actual stele of\n",
      "delimitation we may note that towards the close of its text some\n",
      "four columns were taken up with lists of other conquests achieved\n",
      "by Eannatum. But in all \"kudurru-inscriptions,\" or boundary-stones,\n",
      "which were intended to safeguard the property or claims of private\n",
      "individuals, the texts close with a series of imprecations calling\n",
      "down the anger of the gods upon any one infringing the owner's rights\n",
      "in any way. Now in general character the text upon the Stele of the\n",
      "Vultures closely resembles the \"kudurru-inscriptions,\" only differing\n",
      "from them in that it sets out to delimit, not the fields and estates\n",
      "of individuals, but the respective territories of two city-states.\n",
      "We should therefore expect that, like them, it would close with\n",
      "invocations to the gods. Moreover, the Cone of Entemena, the text of\n",
      "which was undoubtedly copied from a similar stele of delimitation, ends\n",
      "with curses, and not with a list of Entemena's own achievements. But if\n",
      "the short list of Eannatum's titles and conquests be omitted, the text\n",
      "upon the Stele of the Vultures would end with the series of invocations\n",
      "to Enlil and other deities, to which reference has already been made.\n",
      "We may therefore conclude that the original text, as engraved upon the\n",
      "stele of delimitation, did end at this point, and that the list of\n",
      "other conquests was only added upon the memorial erected in Ningirsu's\n",
      "temple.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apart from the interest attaching to the memorial itself, this point\n",
      "has a bearing upon the date of the conquest of Umma in relation to the\n",
      "other successful wars conducted by Eannatum in the course of his reign.\n",
      "It might reasonably be urged that the subjugation of the neighbouring\n",
      "city of Umma would have preceded the conquest of more distant lands and\n",
      "cities, over which Eannatum succeeded in imposing his sway. In that\n",
      "case we must assume that the list of conquests upon the Stele of the\n",
      "Vultures was added at a later date. On the other hand, it is equally\n",
      "possible that the war with Umma took place well on in Eannatum's\n",
      "reign, and that, while the patesi and his army were away on distant\n",
      "expeditions, their ancient rival Umma refrained from taking advantage\n",
      "of their absence to gain control of the coveted territory of Gu-edin.\n",
      "Both cities may for years have respected the terms of Mesilim's treaty,\n",
      "and Lagash, while finding scope elsewhere for her ambition, may have\n",
      "been content to acquiesce in the claims of independence put forward\n",
      "by her nearest neighbour. Thus the list of Eannatum's conquests may\n",
      "well have been engraved upon the Stele of the Vultures at the time\n",
      "the treaty with Umma was drawn up. In accordance with this view we\n",
      "shall see there are reasons for believing that several of Eannatum's\n",
      "conquests did take place before his war with Umma, and it is quite\n",
      "possible to assign to this earlier period the others that are mentioned\n",
      "in the list.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conquest of Kish stands in close relation to that of Umma, for,\n",
      "apart from the portrayal of the king of Kish as a captive upon the\n",
      "Stele of the Vultures, there is a passage in the main body of the\n",
      "inscription which would seem to connect the outbreak of war between\n",
      "Umma and Lagash with the influence of that city. In the broken passage\n",
      "recording the encouragement given to Eannatum by Ningirsu after the\n",
      "raid of Gu-edin, the names of Umma and Kish occur together, and the\n",
      "context of the passage suggests that Ningirsu here promises his patesi\n",
      "victory over both these cities.[30] We may, therefore, conjecture that\n",
      "the ambitious designs described by Entemena as actuating Ush, the\n",
      "patesi of Umma, in raiding the territory of Lagash, were fostered by\n",
      "the city of Kish. It is probable that Eannatum had already given proof\n",
      "of his qualities as a military leader, and had caused the king of Kish\n",
      "to see in Lagash a possible rival for the hegemony which the North had\n",
      "long enjoyed. To sow dissension between her and her neighbour Umma,\n",
      "would have appeared a most effective method of crippling her growing\n",
      "power, and it is possible that the king of Kish not only promised his\n",
      "support, but furnished a contingent of his own soldiers to assist in\n",
      "the attack. The representation of the captive king of Kish upon the\n",
      "Stele of the Vultures may possibly be interpreted as proving that he\n",
      "led his troops in person, and was captured during the battle. But the\n",
      "relief is, perhaps, not to be taken too literally, and may merely\n",
      "symbolize the defeat of his forces along with those of Umma, and his\n",
      "failure to render them any effective aid. On the other hand, in a text\n",
      "engraved upon one of his foundation-stones,[31] Eannatum boasts that\n",
      "he added the kingdom of Kish to his dominions: \"Eannatum, patesi of\n",
      "Lagash, by the goddess Ninni who loves him, along with the patesiate of\n",
      "Lagash was presented with the kingdom of Kish.\" It would seem that in\n",
      "this passage Eannatum lays claim, not only to have defeated Kish, but\n",
      "also to exercising suzeranity over the northern kingdom.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Eannatum's victory over Kish we must probably connect the success\n",
      "which he achieved over another northern city, Opis. For towards the\n",
      "end of the text upon the foundation-stone referred to above, these\n",
      "achievements appear to be described as a single event, or, at least,\n",
      "as two events of which the second closely follows and supplements the\n",
      "first. In the course of the formulÃ¦ celebrating the principal conquests\n",
      "of his reign, Eannatum exclaims: \"By Eannatum was Elam broken in the\n",
      "head, Elam was driven back to his own land; Kish was broken in the\n",
      "head, and the king of Opis was driven back to his own land.\"[32] When\n",
      "referring to the victory over Opis in an earlier passage of the same\n",
      "inscription, Eannatum names the king who attacked him, and, although he\n",
      "does not give many details of the war, it may be inferred that Opis was\n",
      "defeated only after a severe struggle. \"When the king of Opis rose up,\"\n",
      "the text runs, \"Eannatum, whose name was spoken by Ningirsu, pursued\n",
      "Zuzu, king of Opis, from the Antasurra of Ningirsu up to the city of\n",
      "Opis, and there he smote him and destroyed him.\"[33] We have already\n",
      "seen reasons for believing that the king of Kish took an active part in\n",
      "Umma's war with Lagash, and shared her defeat; and we may conjecture\n",
      "that it was to help and avenge his ally that Zuzu, king of Opis,\n",
      "marched south and attacked Eannatum. That he met with some success at\n",
      "first is perhaps indicated by the point from which Eannatum records\n",
      "that he drove him back to his own land. For the Antasurra was a shrine\n",
      "or temple dedicated to Ningirsu, and stood within the territory of\n",
      "Lagash, though possibly upon or near the frontier. Here Eannatum met\n",
      "the invaders in force, and not only dislodged them, but followed up his\n",
      "victory by pursuing them back to their own city, where he claims that\n",
      "he administered a still more crushing defeat. It is possible that the\n",
      "conquest of Ma'er, or Mari, took place at this time, and in connection\n",
      "with the war with Opis and Kish, for in one passage Eannatum refers to\n",
      "the defeat of these three states at the Antasurra of Ningirsu. Ma'er\n",
      "may well have been allied with Kish and Opis, and may have contributed\n",
      "a contingent to the army led by Zuzu in his attack on Lagash.\n",

      "It is interesting to note that Kish and the king of Kish represented\n",
      "the most dreaded enemies of Lagash, at least during a portion of the\n",
      "reign of Eannatum. For on a mortar of black basalt which is preserved\n",
      "in the British Museum,[34] Eannatum, after recording that he has\n",
      "dedicated it to NinÃ¢, \"the Lady of the Holy Mountain,\" prays that\n",
      "no man may damage it or carry it away; and he then adds the petition,\n",
      "\"May the King of Kish not seize it!\" This ejaculation is eloquent of\n",
      "the dread which the northern kingdom inspired in the cities of the\n",
      "south, and we may see in it evidence of many a raid during which the\n",
      "temples of Lagash had been despoiled of their treasures. We may well\n",
      "ascribe the dedication of the altar and the cutting of the inscription\n",
      "to the early part of Eannatum's reign; at any rate, to a period before\n",
      "the power of Kish was broken in the south; and, if we are right in\n",
      "this supposition, the mortar may perhaps serve to date another group\n",
      "of Eannatum's campaigns. For in a passage on the second side of this\n",
      "monument it appears to be recorded that he had conquered the cities\n",
      "of Erech and Ur. The passage follows the invocations set forth by\n",
      "Eannatum upon the other side, in the course of which he prays that no\n",
      "one shall remove the mortar, or cast it into the fire, or damage it in\n",
      "any way; and it might be argued that the lines were an addition made\n",
      "to the original text of dedication at a considerably later period.\n",
      "In that case the passage would afford no proof that the conquest of\n",
      "Ur and Erech preceded that of Kish. But both sides of the monument\n",
      "have the appearance of having been engraved by the same hand, and we\n",
      "are probably justified in assuming that the whole of the inscription\n",
      "was placed upon the vessel at the time it was made. We may thus\n",
      "provisionally place the conquest of Ur and Erech before that of Kish.\n",
      "Further, in his foundation-inscriptions, Eannatum groups his conquest\n",
      "of Ur and Erech with that of Ki-babbar, \"the place of the Sun-god,\" a\n",
      "term which may with considerable probability be identified with Larsa,\n",
      "the centre of the cult of the Sun-god in Southern Babylonia. It would\n",
      "thus appear that Eannatum conquered these cities, all situated in the\n",
      "extreme south of Babylonia at about the same period, and probably in\n",
      "the early part of his reign.\n",
      "\n",
      "An indication that we are right in placing the southern conquests\n",
      "of Eannatum before the war with Umma may, perhaps, be seen in the\n",
      "invocations to deities engraved upon the Stele of the Vultures with\n",
      "which Eannatum sought to protect his treaty. In the course of the\n",
      "invocations Eannatum states that he has made offerings to the goddess\n",
      "Ninkharsag in the city of Kesh, to Enzu, the Moon-god, in Ur, and to\n",
      "Babbar, the Sun-god, in Larsa. These passages we may assume refer to\n",
      "offerings made by Eannatum in his character of suzerain, and, if this\n",
      "view is correct, we must conclude that the conquest of these cities\n",
      "had already taken place. The invocation to Enki perhaps presupposes\n",
      "that Eridu also was in the hands of Eannatum at this time, a corollary\n",
      "that would almost necessarily follow, if the three neighbouring cities\n",
      "of Ur, Erech, and Larsa had fallen before his arms. Accordingly, the\n",
      "list of gods by whom Eannatum and the men of Umma swore to preserve\n",
      "the treaty becomes peculiarly significant. They were selected on\n",
      "political as much as on purely religious grounds, and in their combined\n",
      "jurisdiction represented the extent of Eannatum's dominion in Sumer\n",
      "at the time. That a ruler should be in a position to exact an oath by\n",
      "such powerful city-gods was obviously calculated to inspire respect\n",
      "for his own authority, while the names of the gods themselves formed\n",
      "a sufficient guarantee that divine punishment would surely follow any\n",
      "violation of the treaty. The early successes gained by Eannatum, by\n",
      "which he was enabled to exercise suzerainty over the principal cities\n",
      "of Southern Babylonia, may well have been the cause of his arousing the\n",
      "active hostility of Kish and Opis. When he had emerged victorious from\n",
      "his subsequent struggle with the northern cities, we may assume that he\n",
      "claimed the title of king, which he employs in place of his more usual\n",
      "title of patesi in certain passages in the text of his treaty with Umma.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other conquests recorded in the inscriptions of Eannatum fall into\n",
      "two groups. In all the lists of his victories that have come down\n",
      "to us--on the Stele of the Vultures, the foundation-stones, and the\n",
      "brick-inscriptions--the defeat of Elam is given the first place. This\n",
      "is probably not to be taken as implying that it was the first in order\n",
      "of time. It is true that the order in which the conquered districts\n",
      "and cities are arranged is generally the same in the different lists,\n",
      "but this is not invariably the case. Apart from differences caused by\n",
      "the omission or insertion of names, the order is sometimes altered;\n",
      "thus the conquest of Arua is recorded before that of Ur on the Stele\n",
      "of the Vultures, whereas on the foundation-stones this arrangement\n",
      "is reversed. It would, therefore, be rash to assume that they were\n",
      "enumerated in the order of their occurrence; it is more probable that\n",
      "the conquered states and districts are grouped on a rough geographical\n",
      "basis, and that these groups are arranged according to the importance\n",
      "attaching to them. That Elam should always be mentioned first in the\n",
      "lists is probably due to the fact that she was the hereditary enemy\n",
      "of the cities of Sumer and Akkad, whose rulers could never be sure of\n",
      "immunity from her attacks. The agricultural wealth of Babylonia offered\n",
      "a tempting prey to the hardy tribes who dwelt among the hills upon the\n",
      "western border of Elam, and the dread of the raider and mountaineer,\n",
      "experienced by the dweller in the plain, is expressed by Eannatum in\n",
      "his description of Elam as \"the mountain that strikes terror.\"[35]\n",
      "\n",
      "That in their conflict with Eannatum the Elamites were, as usual, the\n",
      "aggressors, is clear from the words of the record upon his longer\n",
      "foundation-inscription--\"by Eannatum was Elam broken in the head, Elam\n",
      "was driven back to his own land.\"[36] In other passages referring to\n",
      "the discomfiture of the Elamites, Eannatum adds the formula that \"he\n",
      "heaped up burial-mounds,\" a phrase which would seem to imply that the\n",
      "enemy were only defeated with considerable loss.[37] It is not unlikely\n",
      "that we may fix the field of battle, upon which the forces of Elam were\n",
      "defeated, on the banks of the Asukhur Canal, which had been cut two\n",
      "generations before by Ur-NinÃ¢, Eannatum's grandfather; at least, the\n",
      "canal gives its name to a battlefield which is mentioned immediately\n",
      "before the name of Elam in one of the lists of conquests. It would thus\n",
      "seem that the Elamites were engaged in raiding the territory of Lagash\n",
      "when Eannatum fell upon them with his army and drove them northwards\n",
      "and across the Tigris.\n",
      "\n",
      "Closely associated with Eannatum's success against the Elamites were\n",
      "his conquest of Shakh, of a city the reading of the name for which is\n",
      "unknown, and probably also of a land or district which bore the name of\n",
      "Sunanam. The conquest of this last place is only mentioned in a broken\n",
      "passage upon the Stele of the Vultures,[38] between the names of Elam\n",
      "and Shakh, and that of the unknown city, so that little can be inferred\n",
      "with regard to it. Shakh, on the other hand, whenever it is referred\n",
      "to in the inscriptions of Eannatum, follows immediately after the name\n",
      "of Elam, and it was not improbably a district on the Elamite frontier\n",
      "which Eannatum ravaged during his pursuit of the invaders. The city\n",
      "with the unknown name[39] was evidently a place of some importance,\n",
      "for not only was it governed by a patesi, but when its conquest is\n",
      "mentioned in the lists details are usually given. The interpretation\n",
      "of a phrase recording its patesi's action with regard to the emblem of\n",
      "the city is not quite certain, but it would appear that on the approach\n",
      "of Eannatum he planted it before the city-gate. The context would\n",
      "seem to imply that this was intended as an act of defiance, not of\n",
      "submission, for Eannatum states that he conquered the city and heaped\n",
      "up burial-mounds. The site of the city, like its name, is unknown, but\n",
      "since the records referring to it always follow those concerning Elam,\n",
      "we may provisionally regard it as having lain in the direction of the\n",
      "Elamite frontier.\n",
      "\n",
      "The remaining group of Eannatum's conquests comprise the victories he\n",
      "achieved over Az, Mishime, and Arua. The first of these places was\n",
      "a city ruled by a patesi, whom Eannatum slew when he captured and\n",
      "destroyed it. It was formerly regarded as situated in the neighbourhood\n",
      "of the Persian Gulf, but the grounds on which this view was held have\n",
      "proved inadequate.[40] Moreover, Eannatum's references to Mishime and\n",
      "Arua do not assist us much in determining their positions, for he\n",
      "merely states that he destroyed and annihilated them. In a passage\n",
      "upon the Stele of the Vultures, however, a reference to the land of\n",
      "Sumer follows closely upon a record of the conquest of Arua,[41]\n",
      "which perhaps is an indication that all three places should be\n",
      "sought in Southern Babylonia. We are thus without data for settling\n",
      "definitely the region in which this group of cities lay, and we are\n",
      "equally without information as to the period of his reign in which\n",
      "Eannatum captured or destroyed them. The fact that they are mentioned\n",
      "last in the lists is no proof that they were among his most recent\n",
      "conquests; it may merely be due to their relatively small importance.\n",
      "In support of this suggestion we may note that in the longest of his\n",
      "foundation-inscriptions Eannatum refers to them once only, while his\n",
      "successes against Elam and the northern cities are celebrated in two or\n",
      "three separate passages.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the preceding discussion of the campaigns of Eannatum it will have\n",
      "been seen that during his reign a considerable expansion took place\n",
      "in the power and influence of Lagash. From being a city-state with\n",
      "her influence restricted to her own territory, she became head of a\n",
      "confederation of the great Sumerian cities, she successfully disputed\n",
      "with the northern cities the hegemony in Babylonia, and she put a check\n",
      "upon the encroachments of Elam, the hereditary foe of Sumer and Akkad\n",
      "alike. According to the view of Eannatum's conquests which has been\n",
      "put forward, the first expansion of the city's influence took place\n",
      "southwards. The cities of Ur, Erech, Larsa, Kesh, and probably Eridu,\n",
      "had already become her vassal states, before Kish and Opis attempted to\n",
      "curtail her growing power; and in the war which followed it is probable\n",
      "that we may see a struggle between the combined forces of Sumer on the\n",
      "one hand, and those of Akkad on the other. One of the most important\n",
      "episodes in this conflict was the war with Umma, since the raid by the\n",
      "men of that city into the territory of Lagash furnished the occasion\n",
      "for the outbreak of hostilities. The issue of the conflict placed\n",
      "Lagash in the position of the leading city in Babylonia. The fact that\n",
      "from this time forward Eannatum did not permanently adopt the title of\n",
      "\"king\" in his inscriptions, may perhaps be traced to his preference for\n",
      "the religious title of \"patesi,\" which emphasized his dependence upon\n",
      "his own city-god Ningirsu.\n",
      "\n",
      "The military character of Eannatum is reflected in his inscriptions,\n",
      "which in this respect form a striking contrast to those of his\n",
      "grandfather, Ur-NinÃ¢. While the earlier king's records are confined\n",
      "entirely to lists of temples and other buildings, which he erected or\n",
      "restored in Lagash and its neighbourhood, the texts of Eannatum are\n",
      "devoted almost exclusively to his wars. From a few scattered passages,\n",
      "however, we gather that he did not entirely neglect the task of adding\n",
      "to and beautifying the temples in his capital. Thus he built a temple\n",
      "for the goddess Gatumdug, and added to other buildings which were\n",
      "already standing in Ur-NinÃ¢'s time. But his energies in this direction\n",
      "were mainly devoted to repairing the fortifications of Lagash, and to\n",
      "putting the city in a complete state of defence. Thus he boasts that\n",
      "he built the wall of Lagash and made it strong. Since Ur-NinÃ¢'s time,\n",
      "when the city-wall had been thoroughly repaired, it is probable that\n",
      "the defences of the city had been weakened, for Eannatum also records\n",
      "that he restored Girsu, one of the quarters of the city, which we\n",
      "may suppose had suffered on the same occasion, and had been allowed\n",
      "to remain since then in a partly ruined condition. In honour of the\n",
      "goddess NinÃ¢ he also records that he rebuilt, or perhaps largely\n",
      "increased, the quarter of the city which was named after her, and he\n",
      "constructed a wall for the special protection of Uru-azagga, another\n",
      "quarter of Lagash. In fact, the political expansion, which took place\n",
      "at this period in the power of Lagash, was accompanied by an equally\n",
      "striking increase in the size and defences of the city itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the reign of Eannatum it is clear that the people of Lagash\n",
      "enjoyed a considerable measure of prosperity, for, although they were\n",
      "obliged to furnish men for their patesi's army, the state acquired\n",
      "considerable wealth from the sack of conquered cities, and from the\n",
      "tribute of grain and other supplies which was levied upon them as a\n",
      "mark of their permanent subjection. Moreover, the campaigns could not\n",
      "have been of very long duration, and, after the return of the army\n",
      "on the completion of a war, it is probable that the greater part of\n",
      "it would be disbanded, and the men would go back to their ordinary\n",
      "occupations. Thus the successful prosecution of his foreign policy by\n",
      "Eannatum did not result in any impoverishment of the material resources\n",
      "of his people, and the fertile plains around the city were not left\n",
      "untilled for lack of labour. Indeed, it would appear that in the\n",
      "latter part of his reign he largely increased the area of land under\n",
      "cultivation. For in his longer foundation-inscriptions, after recording\n",
      "his principal conquests, he states: \"In that day Eannatum did (as\n",
      "follows). Eannatum, ... when his might had borne fruit, dug a new canal\n",
      "for Ningirsu, and he named it Lummadimdug.\" By the expression \"when his\n",
      "might had borne fruit,\" it is clear that Eannatum refers to the latter\n",
      "part of his reign, when he was no longer obliged to place his army\n",
      "incessantly in the field, and he and his people were enabled to devote\n",
      "themselves to the peaceful task of developing the material resources of\n",
      "their own district in Sumer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another canal, which we know was cut by Eannatum, was that\n",
      "separating the plain of Gu-edin from the territory of Umma, but this\n",
      "was undertaken, not for purposes of irrigation, but rather as a\n",
      "frontier-ditch to mark the limits of the territory of Lagash in that\n",
      "direction. There is little doubt, however, that at least a part of its\n",
      "stream was used for supplying water to those portions of Gu-edin which\n",
      "lay along its banks. Like the canal Lummadimdug, this frontier-ditch\n",
      "was also dedicated to Ningirsu, and in the inscription upon a small\n",
      "column which records this fact, the name of the canal is given as\n",
      "Lummagirnuntashagazaggipadda. But this exceedingly long title was only\n",

      "Lagash as a city-state. We do not know the cause which led to his\n",

      "long, he may have survived his sons. We may indeed conjecture that his\n",

      "its god. Such may well have been the cause of the succession passing\n",
      "from the direct line of descent to a younger branch of the family.\n",
      "That Enannatum followed, and did not precede his brother upon the\n",
      "throne is proved by the reference to him in the El-Hibba text already\n",
      "referred to; moreover, he himself was succeeded by his own immediate\n",
      "descendants, and a reference to his reign upon the Cone of Entemena\n",

      "The few inscriptions of his reign, that have been recovered at Tello\n",

      "the history of Sumer at this period. As it is, our information is in\n",
      "the main confined to the continued rivalry between Lagash and her near\n",
      "neighbour Umma, which now led to a renewal of active hostilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have already seen that, in spite of the increase in the power of\n",
      "Lagash during the reign of Eannatum, the city of Umma had not been\n",
      "incorporated in its dominion, but had succeeded in maintaining an\n",
      "attitude of semi-independence. This is apparent from the terms of the\n",
      "treaty, by which the men of Umma undertook not to invade the territory\n",
      "of Lagash; and, although they paid a heavy tribute in corn to Eannatum,\n",
      "we may assume that they were ready to seize any opportunity that\n",
      "might present itself of repudiating the suzerainty of Lagash. Such\n",
      "an opportunity they may have seen in the death of their conqueror\n",
      "Eannatum, for after the accession of his brother we find them repeating\n",
      "the same tactics they had employed during the preceding reign under\n",
      "the leadership of their patesi, Ush. Enakalli, with whom Eannatum had\n",
      "drawn up his treaty, had been succeeded on the throne by Urlumma. In\n",
      "his cone-inscription Entemena gives no indication as to whether there\n",
      "was any interval between the reign of Enakalli and that of Urlumma.\n",
      "But from a small tablet of lapis-lazuli in the \"Collection de Clercq,\"\n",
      "we gather that the latter was Enakalli's son, and, therefore, probably\n",
      "his direct successor upon the throne.[2] The little tablet was employed\n",
      "as a foundation-memorial, and a short inscription upon it records the\n",
      "building of a temple to the god Enkigal by Urlumma, who describes\n",
      "himself as the son of Enakalli. Each ruler bears the title of \"king\" in\n",
      "the inscription, and, although the reading of the sign following the\n",
      "title is uncertain, there is little doubt that we should identify the\n",
      "Urlumma and Enakalli of the tablet with the two patesis of Umma who are\n",
      "known to have borne these names.\n",
      "\n",
      "Urlumma did not maintain his father's policy, but, following Ush's\n",
      "example, marshalled his army and made a sudden descent upon the\n",
      "territory of Lagash. His raid appears to have been attended with even\n",
      "greater violence than that of his predecessor. Ush had contented\n",
      "himself with merely removing the stele of delimitation set up by\n",
      "Mesilim, but Urlumma broke that of Eannatum in pieces by casting it\n",
      "into the fire, and we may assume that he treated Mesilim's stele in the\n",
      "same way.[3] The shrines, or chapels, which Eannatum had built upon the\n",
      "frontier and had dedicated to the gods whom he had invoked to guard the\n",
      "treaty, were now levelled to the ground. By such acts Urlumma sought\n",
      "to blot out all trace of the humiliating conditions imposed in earlier\n",
      "years upon his city, and, crossing the frontier-ditch of Ningirsu,\n",
      "he raided and plundered the rich plains which it had always been the\n",
      "ambition of Umma to possess.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is probable that Urlumma's object in breaking the treaty was not\n",
      "merely to collect spoil from the fields and villages he overran, but to\n",
      "gain complete possession of the coveted plain. At least, both Entemena\n",
      "and Urukagina record that the subsequent battle between the forces\n",
      "of Umma and Lagash took place within the latter's territory, which\n",
      "would seem to imply that Urlumma and his army did not retreat with\n",
      "their plunder to their own city, but attempted to retain possession of\n",
      "the land itself. Enannatum met the men of Umma in Ugigga, a district\n",
      "within the temple-lands of Ningirsu, where a battle was fought, which,\n",
      "in Urukagina's brief account, is recorded to have resulted in Umma's\n",
      "defeat. Entemena, on the other hand, does not say whether Lagash was\n",
      "victorious, and his silence is possibly significant, for, had his\n",
      "father achieved a decided victory, he would doubtless have recorded\n",
      "it. Moreover, Urlumma continued to give trouble, and it was only in\n",
      "the reign of Entemena himself that he was finally defeated and slain.\n",
      "We may, therefore, conclude that Enannatum did no more than check\n",
      "Urlumma's encroachments, and it is not improbable that the latter\n",
      "retained for the time a considerable portion of the territory which\n",
      "Lagash had enjoyed for several generations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Few other facts are known of the reign of Enannatum I. We gather that\n",
      "he sent men to the mountains, probably of Elam, and caused them to fell\n",
      "cedars there and bring the trunks to Lagash; and from the cedar-wood\n",
      "thus obtained he constructed the roof of a temple, which appears to\n",
      "have been dedicated to Ningirsu. The temple we may probably identify\n",
      "with Ningirsu's famous temple E-ninnÃ», whence we have recovered a\n",
      "mortar, which Enannatum prepared and presented that it might be used\n",
      "for pounding onions in connection with the temple-ritual. Another\n",
      "object dedicated to Ningirsu, which dates from this period, is\n",
      "preserved in the British Museum, and furnishes us with the name of a\n",
      "minister in the service of Enannatum. This is a limestone mace-head,[4]\n",
      "carved with the emblem of Lagash, and bearing an inscription from which\n",
      "we learn that it was deposited in the temple E-ninnÃ» by Barkiba,[5]\n",
      "the minister, to ensure the preservation of the life of Enannatum,\n",
      "\"his king.\" It would appear from this record that, although Enannatum\n",
      "himself adopted the title of \"patesi,\" which he ascribes also to his\n",
      "father Akurgal, it was permissible for his subordinates to refer to\n",
      "him under the title of \"king.\" That \"patesi\" was, however, his usual\n",
      "designation may be inferred not only from his own inscriptions, but\n",
      "from the occurrence of the title after his name upon a deed of sale\n",
      "drawn up on a tablet of black stone,[6] which probably dates from his\n",
      "reign. From this document, as well as from a text inscribed upon clay\n",
      "cones found by Koldewey at El-Hibba,[7] we also learn that Enannatum\n",
      "had a son named Lummadur,[8] in addition to Entemena. It should be\n",
      "noted that neither on the clay cones nor on the tablet of black stone\n",
      "is the name of Enannatum's father recorded, so that the suggestion has\n",
      "been made that they should be referred to Enannatum II., rather than to\n",
      "Enannatum I. But the adornment of the temple E-anna, recorded on the\n",
      "cones, is referred to in the clay-inscription of Enannatum I., which,\n",
      "like the cones, was found at El-Hibba.[9] It is reasonable therefore to\n",
      "assign the cone-inscription also to Enannatum I., and to conclude that\n",
      "Lummadur was his son, rather than the son and possible successor of\n",
      "Enannatum II. The cone-inscription records the installation of Lummadur\n",
      "by his father as priest in E-anna, when that temple had been adorned\n",
      "and embellished in honour of the goddess Ninni. Since Enannatum was\n",
      "succeeded upon the throne of Lagash by Entemena, we may assume that\n",
      "Lummadur was the latter's younger brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the first duties Entemena was called upon to perform, after\n",
      "ascending the throne, was the defence of his territory against further\n",
      "encroachments by Urlumma. It is evident that this ruler closely\n",

      "by seeking assistance from at least one other neighbouring state. His\n",
      "anticipation of securing a decided victory by this means was, however,\n",
      "far from being realized. Entemena lost no time in summoning his forces,\n",

      "demoralized inhabitants had had time to organize or strengthen its\n",
      "defence. Urlumma he captured and slew, and he thus put an end to an\n",
      "ambitious ruler, who for years had undoubtedly caused much trouble\n",
      "and annoyance to Lagash. Entemena's victory was complete, but it was\n",
      "not won without some loss among his own forces, for he heaped up\n",
      "burial-mounds in five separate places, which no doubt covered the\n",

      "city in which Ili was at this time acting as priest was situated not\n",
      "far from Umma. It was under the control of Lagash, and doubtless formed\n",
      "part of the empire which Eannatum had bequeathed to his successors upon\n",
      "the throne. Ili is described as the priest, not the patesi, of the\n",
      "city, and it is possible that his office included the control of its\n",
      "secular administration. But in view of the importance of the place, it\n",
      "is unlikely that it was without a patesi.\n",
      "\n",
      "The installation of Ili in the patesiate of Umma was accompanied by\n",
      "some degree of ceremonial. It would appear that his appointment did not\n",
      "take place immediately after the capture of the town, but that a short\n",
      "interval elapsed between the close of the war and the inauguration\n",
      "of the new government. Meanwhile, Entemena himself had returned to\n",
      "Lagash, and it was to that city that he summoned Ili into his presence.\n",
      "He then set out with Ili from Girsu, and, when Umma was reached, he\n",
      "formally installed him at the head of the government, and conferred on\n",
      "him the title of patesi. At the same time he dictated his own terms to\n",
      "the people of Umma, and commissioned Ili to see that they were duly\n",
      "carried out. In the first place he restored to Lagash the territory\n",
      "to which she had always laid claim, and the ancient frontier-ditches,\n",
      "which had been filled up or had fallen in, he caused to be repaired. In\n",
      "addition to reasserting the traditional rights of Lagash, he annexed\n",
      "new land in the district of Karkar, since its inhabitants had taken\n",
      "part in the recent rebellion, and had probably furnished an important\n",
      "contingent for the army of Urlumma. He gave directions to Ili to\n",
      "extend the two principal frontier-ditches, dedicated to Ningirsu and\n",
      "NinÃ¢ respectively, within the territory of Karkar; and, with the\n",
      "large supply of forced labour which he exacted from his newly annexed\n",
      "subjects, he strengthened the defences of his own territory, and\n",
      "restored and extended the system of canals between the Euphrates and\n",
      "the Tigris. But Entemena did not content himself with exacting land\n",
      "and labour only from the conquered city. He imposed a heavy tribute in\n",
      "corn, and it was probably one of Ili's most important duties as patesi\n",
      "to superintend its collection and ensure its punctual transfer into the\n",
      "granaries of Lagash.\n",

      "In order to commemorate the conquest and annexation of Umma, Entemena\n",

      "was probably set up upon the frontier to serve as a memorial of his\n",
      "achievements. Fortunately for us, he did not confine the records to\n",
      "his own victories, but prefaced them with an epitomized account of\n",
      "the relations which had existed between Lagash and Umma from the time\n",
      "of Mesilim until his own day. Other copies of the inscription were\n",
      "probably engraved upon stone and set up in the cities of Umma and\n",
      "Lagash, and, in order to increase still further the chances in favour\n",
      "of the preservation of his record, he had copies inscribed upon small\n",

      "and we may conclude that he had them buried beneath the buildings he\n",
      "erected or repaired upon the frontier-canals, and also perhaps in the\n",
      "foundations of temples within the city of Lagash itself. Entemena's\n",
      "foresight in multiplying the number of his texts, and in burying them\n",
      "in the structure of his buildings, was in accordance with the practice\n",
      "of the period; and in his case the custom has been fully justified.\n",
      "So far as we know, his great stone stelÃ¦ have perished; but one of\n",

      "we have doubtless recovered the greater part, if not the whole, of\n",
      "Entemena's record. The stelÃ¦ may have been engraved with elaborate\n",
      "curses, intended to preserve the frontier-ditch from violation, and,\n",
      "though these have been omitted in the shorter version of the text,\n",
      "their place is taken by the brief invocation and prayer with which the\n",

      "the boundary-ditch of NinÃ¢, in order to lay violent hands upon the\n",

      "And, should the warriors of his own city be called upon to defend it,\n",

      "\n",
      "Apart from the cone recording the conquest of Umma, the inscriptions\n",
      "of Entemena do not throw much light upon the military achievements\n",
      "of his reign. Three fragments of a limestone vase have been found at\n",
      "Nippur in the strata beneath the temple of Enlil on the south-east side\n",
      "of the ziggurat, or temple-tower, bearing on their outer surface a\n",

      "fragmentary character of the inscription prevents us from identifying\n",
      "the enemy who was subdued on this occasion; but we shall probably be\n",
      "right in taking the passage as referring, not to the conquest of Umma,\n",

      "the vase as evidence that Entemena attempted to retain his hold upon\n",
      "the empire which Eannatum had founded, and did not shrink from the\n",
      "necessity of undertaking military expeditions to attain this object. In\n",
      "further support of this view we may perhaps cite a reference to one of\n",

      "or produced artificially.[16] While this substance was still in a\n",
      "pliant state the block was formed from it, and the designs with the\n",

      "the substance to be procured from the city in question suggests that\n",
      "friendly relations existed between it and Lagash at the time; it is\n",
      "quite possible that it had not, meanwhile, secured its independence,\n",
      "but still continued to acknowledge the suzerainty of the latter city.\n",

      "property of the city-god, was somewhat unusual, and its occurrence\n",

      "themselves furnish indications that in any case the interval between\n",
      "Enannatum II. and Urukagina was not a long one. It had for some\n",
      "time been suspected that Enlitarzi and Lugal-anda lived at about\n",
      "the same period, for a steward named Shakh was employed by the wife\n",
      "of Enlitarzi as well as by Barnamtarra, the wife of Lugal-anda.[25]\n",
      "This inference has now been confirmed by the discovery of a document\n",
      "proving that Lugal-anda was Enlitarzi's son; for a clay cone has been\n",
      "found, inscribed with a contract concerning the sale of a house, the\n",
      "contracting parties being the family of Lugal-anda, described as\n",
      "\"the son of Enlitarzi, the priest,\" and the family of Barnamtarra,\n",
      "Lugal-anda's future wife.[26] Moreover, we have grounds for believing\n",
      "that Lugal-anda was not only the last of the three patesis whose names\n",
      "have been recovered, but was Urukagina's immediate predecessor. An\n",
      "indication that this was the case may be seen in the fact that the\n",

      "was also employed by Urukagina and his wife Shagshag. Confirmation\n",
      "of this view has been found in the text upon a tablet, dated in the\n",
      "first year of Urukagina's reign as king, in which mention is made of\n",

      "That this was not a long period is clear from the fact that Enlitarzi\n",

      "patesi, for the wife of the priest, who is mentioned in the contract,\n",
      "bears the same name as the wife of the patesi.[29] Since, therefore,\n",
      "Enlitarzi already occupied the high position of chief priest of\n",

      "which this fact may be inferred is an extremely interesting one,[30]\n",
      "for it consists of the earliest example of a letter or despatch that\n",
      "has yet been found on any Babylonian site. It was discovered at Tello\n",
      "during the recent excavations of Commandant Cros, and, alike in the\n",
      "character of its writing and in its general appearance, it closely\n",
      "resembles the tablets of accounts from the patesis' private archive, to\n",
      "which reference has already been made. The despatch was written by a\n",
      "certain Lu-enna, chief priest of the goddess Ninmar, and is addressed\n",
      "to Enetarzi, chief priest of the god Ningirsu. At first sight its\n",
      "contents are scarcely those which we should expect to find in a letter\n",
      "addressed by one chief priest to another. For the writer informs his\n",
      "correspondent that a band of Elamites had pillaged the territory of\n",

      "rate, a complete break took place, not only in the succession, but\n",
      "also in the traditions and principles which had guided for so long the\n",
      "ruling family at Lagash. That Urukagina did not obtain the throne by\n",
      "right of succession is clear from the total absence of any genealogies\n",
      "in his inscriptions. He does not even name his father,[35] so that we\n",
      "may trace his succession to his own initiative. He himself ascribes\n",
      "to Ningirsu his elevation to the throne, and the phrase that follows\n",
      "suggests that this was not accomplished without a struggle. When\n",
      "describing in detail the drastic reforms which he had carried out in\n",
      "the internal administration of the state, he prefaces his account by\n",
      "stating that they took place when Ningirsu had given him the kingdom of\n",
      "Lagash and had established his might. In view of these very reforms,\n",
      "we may regard it as extremely probable that he headed a reaction\n",
      "against certain abuses which had characterized the recent government of\n",
      "the city, and that, in usurping the throne, he owed his success to a\n",
      "wide-spread feeling of discontent among the great body of the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further evidence of a complete break in the succession may be seen in\n",
      "the change of the patron deity, whose protection the reigning house\n",
      "enjoyed. Urukagina no longer invoked the god on whom the dynasty of\n",
      "Ur-NinÃ¢ had relied for intercession with Ningirsu,[36] and in his place\n",
      "addressed himself to Ninshakh. The very title which Urukagina himself\n",
      "adopted is probably significant of his antagonism to the family which\n",
      "for so long had directed the destinies of the state. While even the\n",
      "great conqueror Eannatum had proudly clung to the title of \"patesi,\"\n",
      "and his successors on the throne had followed his example, in every one\n",
      "of his own inscriptions that have been recovered Urukagina rejects it\n",
      "in favour of that of \"king.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It would appear that he did not inaugurate this change immediately\n",
      "upon his accession, and that for at least a year he continued to use\n",
      "the title employed by his predecessors. For some of the tablets of\n",
      "accounts from the private archive of the patesis, to which reference\n",
      "has already been made,[37] appear to be dated in the first year of\n",
      "Urukagina's patesiate; while the other documents of this class, which\n",
      "refer to him, are dated from the first to the sixth year of his reign\n",
      "as king. So that, if there is no gap in the sequence, we may conclude\n",
      "that he discarded the former title after having occupied the throne\n",
      "for one year. His dropping of this time-honoured designation may well\n",
      "have accompanied the abolition of privileges and abuses with which it\n",
      "had become associated in the mind of the people. Indeed, the tone of\n",
      "his inscriptions reflects no feeling of veneration for the title of\n",
      "patesi, nor does he appear anxious to commemorate the names of those\n",
      "who had borne it. Thus in one of his texts, when he has occasion to\n",
      "give a brief historical summary of an earlier struggle between Lagash\n",
      "and Umma, he names the ruler of the latter city, but he ascribes the\n",
      "former's victory to Ningirsu, and does not seem to have referred to\n",
      "Enannatum I. and Entemena, in whose reigns the events took place.[38]\n",
      "\n",
      "But it is in the reforms themselves, which Urukagina introduced,\n",
      "that we find the most striking evidence of the complete severance he\n",
      "made from the cherished traditions of his predecessors. In a series\n",
      "of very striking texts, of which we now possess three versions,[39]\n",
      "he has left us a record of the changes he introduced in the internal\n",
      "administration of the country. In the condition in which at least two\n",
      "of these versions have come down to us a literary artifice is employed,\n",
      "which enhances and emphasizes in a remarkable degree the drastic\n",
      "character of his reforms. Before enumerating these, the writer provides\n",
      "a striking contrast by describing the condition of the country which\n",
      "preceded their introduction by the king. We are thus confronted with\n",
      "two companion pictures, the main features of which correspond, while\n",
      "their underlying characters are completely changed. In the two sections\n",
      "of each text the general phraseology is much the same, the difference\n",
      "consisting in the fact that, while the first describes the oppression\n",
      "and injustice which had existed in the state of Lagash \"since distant\n",
      "days, from the beginning,\" the second section enumerates the reforms\n",
      "by which Urukagina claimed that he had ameliorated the people's lot.\n",
      "Though some of the references they contain are still obscure, the texts\n",
      "afford us a welcome glimpse of the economic conditions that prevailed\n",
      "in Sumer. In contrast to other royal inscriptions found at Tello, they\n",
      "give us information concerning the daily life and occupations of the\n",
      "people; and at the same time they reveal beneath the official decorum\n",
      "of a Sumerian court an amount of oppression and misery, the existence\n",
      "of which would not be suspected from the pious foundation-inscriptions\n",
      "and votive texts of the period.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conquests achieved by Lagash during the epoch of the great patesis\n",
      "had undoubtedly added considerably to the wealth of the city, and had\n",
      "given her, at least for a time, the hegemony in Southern Babylonia. But\n",
      "with the growth of her power as a state, she lost many of the qualities\n",
      "by virtue of which her earlier successes were achieved. The simplicity,\n",
      "which characterized the patesi's household at a time when he was little\n",
      "more than a chief among his fellows, was gradually exchanged for the\n",
      "elaborate organization of a powerful court. When the army returned\n",
      "laden with booty from distant regions, and the tribute of conquered\n",
      "cities kept the granaries of Ningirsu filled, it was but natural that\n",
      "the rulers of Lagash should surround themselves with greater luxury,\n",
      "and should enrich their city by the erection of palaces for themselves\n",
      "and sumptuous temples for the gods. The long lists of temples and other\n",
      "buildings, which occupy the greater part of the inscriptions left us\n",
      "by Ur-NinÃ¢ and his descendants, testify to their activity in this\n",
      "direction. It will be obvious that the beautification of the capital,\n",
      "begun in an era of conquest, could not be continued in less fortunate\n",
      "times without putting a considerable strain upon the resources of the\n",
      "state. In such circumstances the agricultural section of the population\n",
      "were forced to contribute the means for gratifying the ambition of\n",
      "their rulers. New taxes were levied, and, to ensure their collection,\n",
      "a host of inspectors and other officials were appointed whose numbers\n",
      "would constantly tend to increase. \"Within the limits of the territory\n",
      "of Ningirsu,\" says Urukagina, \"there were inspectors down to the\n",
      "sea.\"[40]\n",
      "\n",
      "The palace of the patesi thus began to usurp the place in the national\n",
      "life which had formerly been held by the temple of the city-god, and,\n",
      "while the people found that the tithes due to the latter were not\n",
      "diminished, they were faced with additional taxation on all sides.\n",
      "Tax-gatherers and inspectors were appointed in every district and\n",
      "for every class of the population. The cultivators of the soil, the\n",
      "owners of flocks and herds, the fishermen, and the boatmen plying on\n",
      "the rivers and canals, were never free from the rapacity of these\n",
      "officials, who, in addition to levying their dues, appear to have\n",
      "billeted themselves on their unfortunate victims. That corruption\n",
      "should have existed in the ranks of his officials was but natural, when\n",
      "the patesi himself set them an example in the matter; for Urukagina\n",
      "records that his predecessors on the throne had appropriated the\n",
      "property of the temples for their own use. The oxen of the gods, he\n",
      "tells us, were employed for the irrigation of the lands given to the\n",
      "patesi; the good fields of the gods formed the patesi's holding and\n",
      "his place of joy.[41] The priests themselves grew rich at the expense\n",
      "of the temples, and plundered the people with impunity. The asses and\n",
      "fine oxen which were temple-property they carried off, they exacted\n",
      "additional tithes and offerings, and throughout the country they\n",
      "entered the gardens of the poor and cut down the trees or carried\n",
      "off the fruits. But while so doing they kept on good terms with the\n",
      "palace officials; for Urukagina records that the priests divided the\n",
      "temple-corn with the people of the patesi, and brought them tribute in\n",
      "garments, cloth, thread, vessels and objects of copper, birds, kids,\n",
      "and the like.\n",
      "\n",
      "The misappropriation of temple-property, and particularly that of\n",
      "the city-god, afforded Urukagina the pretext for inaugurating his\n",
      "reforms. He stood forth as Ningirsu's champion, and by restoring the\n",
      "sacred lands which had been seized by the palace, he proved his own\n",
      "disinterestedness, and afforded his subjects an example which he\n",
      "could insist upon their following. He states that in the house of the\n",
      "patesi and in the field of the patesi he installed Ningirsu, their\n",
      "master; that in the house of the harÃ®m and in the field of the harÃ®m\n",
      "he installed the goddess Bau, their mistress; and that in the house of\n",
      "the children and in the field of the children he installed Dunshagga,\n",
      "their master.[42] In these three phrases Urukagina not only records the\n",
      "restoration of all the property, which had formerly belonged to the\n",
      "temples dedicated to Ningirsu and his family, but also reaffirms the\n",
      "old relation of the patesi to the city-god. In the character of his\n",
      "representative the patesi only received his throne as a trust to be\n",
      "administered in the interest of the god; his fields, and goods, and all\n",
      "that he possessed were not his own property but Ningirsu's.[43]\n",
      "\n",
      "After carrying out these reforms, Urukagina proceeded to attack the\n",
      "abuses which existed among the secular officials and the priests. He\n",
      "cut down the numbers of the former, and abolished the unnecessary\n",
      "posts and offices which pressed too hardly on the people. The\n",
      "granary-inspectors, the fishery-inspectors, the boat-inspectors, the\n",
      "inspectors of flocks and herds, and, in fact, the army of officials who\n",
      "farmed the revenue and made a good profit out of it themselves, were\n",
      "all deprived of office. Abuses which had sprung up and had obtained the\n",
      "recognition accorded to long-established custom, were put down with a\n",
      "strong hand. All those who had taken money in place of the appointed\n",
      "tribute were removed from their posts, as were those officials of the\n",
      "palace who had accepted bribes from the priests. The priests themselves\n",
      "were deprived of many of their privileges, and their scale of fees was\n",
      "revised. Burial fees in particular were singled out for revision, for\n",
      "they had become extortionate; they were now cut down by more than half.\n",
      "In the case of an ordinary burial, when a corpse was laid in the grave,\n",
      "it had been the custom for the presiding priest to demand as a fee for\n",
      "himself seven urns of wine or strong drink, four hundred and twenty\n",
      "loaves of bread, one hundred and twenty measures of corn, a garment,\n",
      "a kid, a bed, and a seat. This formidable list of perquisites was now\n",
      "reduced to three urns of wine, eighty loaves of bread, a bed, and a\n",
      "kid, while the fee of his assistant was cut down from sixty to thirty\n",
      "measures of corn. Similar reductions were made in other fees demanded\n",
      "by the priesthood, and allowances of wine, loaves, and grain, which\n",
      "were paid to various privileged classes and officials in Lagash, were\n",
      "revised and regulated.\n",
      "\n",
      "As was but natural, oppression and robbery had not been confined to\n",
      "the priestly and official classes, but were practised with impunity\n",
      "by the more powerful and lawless sections of the population, with\n",
      "the result that no man's property was safe. In the old days if a man\n",
      "purchased a sheep and it was a good one, he ran the risk of having it\n",
      "stolen or confiscated. If he built himself a fish-pond, his fish were\n",
      "taken and he had no redress. If he sunk a well in high ground beyond\n",
      "the area served by the irrigation-canals, he had no security that his\n",
      "labour would be for his own benefit. This state of things Urukagina\n",
      "changed, both by putting an end to the extortions of officials and by\n",
      "imposing drastic penalties for theft. At the same time, he sought to\n",
      "protect by law the humbler classes of his subjects from oppression by\n",
      "their wealthier and more powerful neighbours. Thus he enacted that if a\n",
      "good ass was foaled in the stable of any subject of the king, and his\n",
      "superior should wish to buy it, he should only do so by paying a fair\n",
      "price; and if the owner refused to part with it, his superior must not\n",
      "molest him. Similarly, if the house of a great man lay beside that of\n",
      "a humbler subject of the king and he wished to buy it, he must pay a\n",
      "fair price; and if the owner was unwilling to sell it, he should have\n",
      "perfect liberty to refuse without any risk to himself. The same desire\n",
      "to lessen the hardships of the poorer classes is apparent in other\n",
      "reforms of Urukagina, by which he modified the more barbarous customs\n",
      "of earlier days. One instance of such a reform appears to apply to the\n",
      "_corvÃ©e_, or some kindred institution; when engaged in a form of forced\n",
      "labour, it had not been the custom to supply the workers with water for\n",
      "drinking, nor even to allow them to fetch it for themselves--a practice\n",
      "to which Urukagina put a stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "The extent to which the common people had been mulcted of their\n",
      "property by the officials of the palace is well illustrated by two of\n",
      "Urukagina's reforms, from which it would appear that the patesi himself\n",
      "and his chief minister, or grand vizir, had enriched themselves by\n",
      "enforcing heavy and unjust fees. One instance concerns the practice of\n",
      "divination by oil, which at this time seems to have been a not uncommon\n",
      "method of foretelling the future. If we may judge from inscriptions\n",
      "of a rather later period, the procedure consisted in pouring out oil\n",
      "upon the surface of water, the different forms taken by the oil on\n",
      "striking the water indicating the course which events would take.[44]\n",
      "To interpret correctly the message of the oil a professional diviner\n",
      "was required, and Urukagina relates that not only did the diviner\n",
      "demand a fee of one shekel for his services, but a similar fee had to\n",
      "be paid to the grand vizir, and no less than five shekels to the patesi\n",
      "himself. That these fees should have been keenly resented is in itself\n",
      "a proof of the extent to which this form of divination was practised.\n",
      "Urukagina tells us that after his accession the patesi, the vizir, and\n",
      "the diviner took money no more; and, since the latter's fee was also\n",
      "abolished, we may probably infer that diviners were a recognized class\n",
      "of the official priesthood, and were not allowed to accept payment\n",
      "except in the form of offerings for the temple to which they were\n",
      "attached.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other matter in which it had been the custom of the patesi and his\n",
      "vizir to accept fees was one in which the evil effects of the practice\n",
      "are more obvious. Urukagina tells us that under the old regime, if\n",
      "a man put away his wife, the patesi took for himself five shekels\n",
      "of silver and the grand vizir one. It is possible that, upon their\n",
      "first introduction, these fees were defended as being a deterrent to\n",
      "divorce. But in practice they had the contrary effect. Divorce could be\n",
      "obtained on no grounds whatever by the payment of what was practically\n",
      "a bribe to the officials, with the result that the obligations of the\n",
      "marriage tie were not respected. The wives of aforetime, according to\n",
      "Urukagina, were possessed by two men with impunity. While abolishing\n",
      "the official fees for divorce, it is probable that Urukagina drew up\n",
      "regulations to ensure that it was not abused, and that compensation,\n",
      "when merited, should be paid to the woman. On the other hand, we have\n",
      "evidence that he inflicted severe punishment for infidelity on the\n",
      "part of the wife, and we may assume that by this means he attempted to\n",
      "stamp out practices which were already beginning to be a danger to the\n",
      "existence of the community.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is interesting to note that the laws referred to by Urukagina,\n",
      "in giving an account of the changes he introduced, are precisely\n",
      "similar in form to those we find upon the Code of Hammurabi.[45] This\n",
      "fact furnishes definite proof, not only that Hammurabi codified the\n",
      "legislation of earlier times, but also that this legislation itself\n",
      "was of Sumerian origin.[46] It is probable that Urukagina himself,\n",
      "in introducing his reforms, revived the laws of a still earlier age,\n",
      "which had been allowed to fall into disuse. As Hammurabi ascribed the\n",
      "origin of his laws to the Sun-god, whom he represents upon his stele\n",
      "as reciting them to him, so Urukagina regards his reforms as due to\n",
      "the direct intervention of Ningirsu, his king, whose word it was he\n",
      "caused to dwell in the land;[47] and it was not with his people but\n",
      "with Ningirsu that he drew up the agreement to observe them.[48] Like\n",
      "Hammurabi, too, Urukagina boasts that he is the champion of the weak\n",
      "against the strong; and he tells us that in place of the servitude,\n",
      "which had existed in his kingdom, he established liberty.[49] He spoke,\n",
      "and delivered the children of Lagash from want, from theft, from\n",
      "murder and other ills. In his reign, he says, to the widow and the\n",
      "orphan the strong man did no harm.[50]\n",
      "\n",
      "Urukagina's championship of Ningirsu's rights is reflected, not only\n",
      "in his reforms, but also in the buildings he erected during his reign.\n",
      "Thus we find it recorded that, in addition to his great temple E-ninnÃ»,\n",
      "he built or restored two other temples in his honour, his palace of\n",
      "Tirash, and his great storehouse. Other temples were erected in honour\n",
      "of Bau, his wife, and of Dunshagga and Galalim, two of Ningirsu's\n",
      "sons, the latter of whom is first mentioned in Urukagina's texts. To\n",
      "Khegir, one of the seven virgin daughters of Ningirsu, he dedicated\n",
      "a shrine, and he built another in honour of three of her sisters,\n",
      "Zarzari, Impae, and Urnuntaea; a third was dedicated to Ninsar,\n",
      "Ningirsu's sword-bearer. It may thus be inferred that Urukagina's\n",
      "building operations were mainly devoted to temples and shrines of the\n",
      "city-god Ningirsu, and to those dedicated to members of his family\n",
      "and household. Like Eannatum and Entemena, he also improved the\n",
      "water-supply of the city, and cut a canal, or more probably improved\n",
      "an old one, for bringing water to the quarter of the city named NinÃ¢.\n",
      "In connection with it he constructed a reservoir, with a capacity of\n",
      "eighteen hundred and twenty _gur_, which he made, he tells us, \"like\n",
      "the midst of the sea.\"[51] The small canal of Girsu he also repaired,\n",
      "and he revived its former name, \"Ningirsu is prince in Nippur.\"[52]\n",
      "This furnishes another instance of his policy of restoring to Ningirsu\n",
      "honours and privileges of which he had been deprived. The reference to\n",
      "Nippur is of interest, for it suggests that Urukagina maintained active\n",
      "relations with the central cult of Sumer and the north, an inference\n",
      "confirmed by his rebuilding of Enlil's temple in Lagash, which had been\n",
      "previously built by Entemena.\n",
      "\n",
      "Allusions to cities other than Lagash and its component parts in\n",
      "Urukagina's inscriptions are few, and those that do occur fail\n",
      "to throw much light upon the relations he maintained with other\n",
      "city-states. A small object of clay in the form of an olive[53] has\n",
      "been found, which bears the votive inscription: \"Ningirsu speaks\n",
      "good words with Bau concerning Urukagina in the temple of Erech,\"--a\n",
      "phrase that seems to imply a claim on the part of Lagash to suzerainty\n",
      "over that city. Another votive object of the same class mentions the\n",
      "fortification of the wall of E-babbar,[54] but the reference here is\n",
      "probably not to the famous temple of the Sun-god at Larsa, but to his\n",
      "smaller temple of this name, which stood in Lagash and was afterwards\n",
      "desecrated by the men of Umma. The only other foreign city mentioned\n",
      "in Urukagina's inscriptions is Umma itself, whose relations to Lagash\n",
      "in the reigns of Enannatum I. and Entemena are briefly recorded.[55]\n",
      "The text of the passage is broken, but we may surmise that the short\n",
      "summary of events was intended to introduce an account of Urukagina's\n",
      "own relations with that city. We may note the fact, which this\n",
      "reference proves, that the subsequent descent of the men of Umma upon\n",
      "Lagash and their capture and sack of the city were the result of\n",
      "friction, and possibly of active hostility, during at least a portion\n",
      "of Urukagina's reign.\n",
      "\n",
      "From Urukagina's own texts we thus do not gather much information with\n",
      "regard to the extent of the empire of Lagash under his rule. That\n",
      "he did not neglect the actual defences of his city may be inferred\n",
      "from his repair of the wall of Girsu; it is clear, however, that his\n",
      "interest was not in foreign conquest, nor even in maintaining the\n",
      "existing limits of his dominion, but in internal reform. He devoted\n",
      "all his energies to purifying the administration of his own land,\n",
      "and to stamping out the abuses under which for so long the people\n",
      "had suffered. That he benefited the land as a whole, and earned the\n",
      "gratitude of his poorer subjects, there can be no doubt; but it is\n",
      "to his reforms themselves that we may trace the immediate cause of\n",
      "the downfall of his kingdom. For his zeal had led him to destroy the\n",
      "long-established methods of government, and, though he thereby put\n",
      "an end to corruption, he failed to provide an adequate substitute to\n",
      "take their place. The host of officials he abolished or dispossessed\n",
      "of office had belonged to a military administration, which had made\n",
      "the name of Lagash feared, and they had doubtless been organized with\n",
      "a view to ensuring the stability and protection of the state. Their\n",
      "disappearance mattered little in times of peace; though, even so,\n",
      "Urukagina must have had trouble with the various powerful sections of\n",
      "the population whom he had estranged. When war threatened he must have\n",
      "found himself without an army and without the means of raising one. To\n",
      "this cause we may probably trace the completeness of Umma's victory.\n",
      "\n",
      "From what we know of the early history of Sumer, it would appear that\n",
      "most of its city-states were subject to alternate periods of expansion\n",
      "and decay; and we have already seen reason to believe that, before\n",
      "the reign of Urukagina, the reaction had already set in, which must\n",
      "inevitably have followed the conquests of the earlier patesis. The\n",
      "struggle for the throne, which appears to have preceded Urukagina's\n",
      "accession, must have weakened still further the military organization\n",
      "of the state; and when Urukagina himself, actuated by the best of\n",
      "motives, attempted to reform and remodel its entire constitution, he\n",
      "rendered it still more defenceless before the attack of any resolute\n",
      "foe. The city of Umma was not slow to take advantage of so favourable\n",
      "an opportunity for striking at her ancient rival. Hitherto in their\n",
      "wars with Lagash the men of Umma, so far as we know, had never\n",
      "ventured, or been allowed, to attack the city. In earlier days Umma\n",
      "had always been defeated, or at any rate her encroachments had been\n",
      "checked. It is true that in the records that have come down to us\n",
      "the men of Umma are represented as always taking the initiative, and\n",
      "provoking hostilities by crossing the frontier-ditch which marked the\n",
      "limit of their possessions. But they never aimed at more than the\n",
      "seizure of territory, and the patesi of Lagash was always strong enough\n",
      "to check their advance, and generally to expel them, before they\n",
      "reached the city itself. Indeed, Entemena had done more than this,\n",
      "and, by his capture and annexation of Umma, had crippled for a time\n",
      "the resources of this ambitious little state. At what period exactly\n",
      "Umma repudiated the suzerainty he had imposed is not known; but in\n",
      "any case we may conclude that the effects of the chastisement she had\n",
      "received at his hands were sufficient to prevent for a time any active\n",
      "encroachments on her part.\n",
      "\n",
      "The renewed activity of Umma during Urukagina's reign doubtless\n",
      "followed the lines of her earlier attempts, and took the form of a raid\n",
      "into the territory of Lagash. The comparative success, which we may\n",
      "conjecture she achieved on this occasion, doubtless encouraged her to\n",
      "further efforts, and emboldened her patesi to attack the city of Lagash\n",
      "itself. The ruler of Umma, under whose leadership this final attack was\n",
      "delivered, bore the name of Lugal-zaggisi. From an inscription of his\n",
      "own, to which further reference will be made in the following chapter,\n",
      "we learn that his father Ukush had been patesi of Umma before him. We\n",
      "may thus assume that the city had for some time enjoyed a position of\n",
      "independence, of which she had taken advantage to husband her resources\n",
      "and place her army on a satisfactory footing. In any case it was strong\n",
      "enough to overcome any opposition that Urukagina could offer, and the\n",
      "city of Lagash, which had been beautified and enriched by the care of a\n",
      "long line of successful rulers, was laid waste and spoiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "The document from which we learn details of the sack of Lagash is a\n",
      "strange one.[56] It closely resembles in shape and writing the tablets\n",
      "of household accounts from the archive of the patesis, which date from\n",
      "the reigns of Urukagina and his immediate predecessors;[57] but the\n",
      "text inscribed upon it consists of an indictment of the men of Umma,\n",
      "drawn up in a series of short sentences, which recapitulate the deeds\n",
      "of sacrilege committed by them. It is not a royal nor an official\n",
      "inscription, and, so far as one can judge from its position when\n",
      "discovered by Commandant Cros, it does not seem to have been stored in\n",
      "any regular archive or depository. For it was unearthed, at a depth of\n",
      "about two metres below the surface of the soil, to the north of the\n",
      "mound which covered the most ancient constructions at Tello,[58] and\n",
      "no other tablets were found near it. Both from its form and contents\n",
      "the document would appear to have been the work of some priest, or\n",
      "scribe, who had formerly been in Urukagina's service; and we may\n",
      "picture him, after the sack of the city, giving vent to his feelings\n",
      "by enumerating the sacred buildings which had been profaned by the\n",
      "men of Umma, and laying the weight of the great sin committed upon\n",
      "the head of the goddess whom they and their patesi served. That the\n",
      "composition was written shortly after the fall of Lagash may be held\n",
      "to explain the absence of any historical setting or introduction; the\n",
      "city's destruction and the profanation of her shrines have so recently\n",
      "taken place that the writer has no need to explain the circumstances.\n",
      "He plunges at once into his accusations against the men of Umma, and\n",
      "the very abruptness of his style and the absence of literary ornament\n",
      "render their delivery more striking. The repetition of phrases and the\n",
      "recurrent use of the same formulÃ¦ serve only to heighten the cumulative\n",

      "Antasurra, the palace of Tirash, the Akhush, the Baga, and the Dugru\n",

      "\n",
      "The sack and destruction of Lagash, which has been described in the\n",
      "preceding chapter, closes an epoch, not only in the fortunes of that\n",
      "city, but also in the history of the lands of Sumer and Akkad. When\n",
      "following the struggles of the early city-states, we have hitherto been\n",
      "able to arrange our material in strict chronological order by the help\n",
      "of a nearly unbroken succession of rulers, whose inscriptions have been\n",
      "recovered during the French excavations at Tello. These have enabled\n",
      "us to reconstruct the history of Lagash herself in some detail, and\n",
      "from the references they furnish to other great cities it has been\n",
      "possible to estimate the influence she exerted from time to time among\n",
      "her neighbours. It is true that the records, from which our information\n",
      "is derived, were drawn up by the rulers of Lagash whose deeds they\n",
      "chronicle, and are naturally far from being impartial authorities. A\n",
      "victory may sometimes have been claimed, when the facts may not have\n",
      "fully justified it; and to this extent we have been forced to view the\n",
      "history of Sumer and of Akkad from the standpoint of a single city.\n",
      "Had the sites of other cities yielded as rich a harvest as Tello, it\n",
      "is probable that other states would be found to have played no less\n",
      "important parts. But in any case it may be regarded as certain that for\n",
      "a time at least Lagash enjoyed the hegemony which it was the ambition\n",
      "of every state of Sumer and Akkad to possess. This leading position\n",
      "had been definitely secured to her by the conquests of Eannatum, and,\n",
      "although under his successors her influence may have diminished, it\n",
      "must have still remained considerable until the victory of Umma put an\n",
      "end to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lugal-zaggisi, the conqueror of Lagash, is mentioned by name in the\n",
      "document from which our knowledge of the catastrophe is derived.\n",
      "The unknown writer of that composition, as we have already seen,\n",
      "assigns to him the title \"patesi of Umma,\" and, had we no other\n",
      "information concerning him, we might perhaps have concluded that\n",
      "his success against the ancient rival of his own city was merely an\n",
      "isolated achievement. In the long-continued struggle between these\n",
      "neighbouring states Umma had finally proved victorious, and the\n",
      "results of this victory might have been regarded as of little more\n",
      "than local importance.[1] But, even before the discovery of the\n",
      "record, Lugal-zaggisi's name was known as that of a great conqueror,\n",
      "and it will be seen that his defeat of Urukagina was only one step in\n",
      "a career of conquest, in the course of which he subdued the whole of\n",
      "Sumer and consolidated a dominion as great as, if not greater than, any\n",
      "hitherto acquired by the ruler of a city-state. The inscription from\n",
      "which we obtain our knowledge of Lugal-zaggisi's career is engraved\n",
      "upon a number of fragments of vases, made of white calcite stalagmite,\n",
      "which were discovered at Nippur during the excavations carried out by\n",
      "the University of Pennsylvania. All the vases were broken into small\n",
      "pieces, but, as each had been engraved with the same inscription, it\n",
      "was found possible, by piecing the fragments together, to reconstruct\n",
      "a more or less complete copy of the text.[2] From this we learn that\n",
      "Lugal-zaggisi had dedicated the vases to Enlil, and had deposited them\n",
      "as votive offerings in the great temple of E-kur.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately, Lugal-zaggisi prefaces his record of their dedication\n",
      "with a long list of his own titles and achievements, which make up\n",
      "the greater part of the inscription. From this portion of the text we\n",
      "gather considerable information with regard to the cities under his\n",
      "control, and the limits of the empire to which he laid claim at the\n",
      "time the record was drawn up. The text opens with an enumeration of the\n",
      "royal titles, in which Lugal-zaggisi is described as \"King of Erech,\n",
      "king of the land, priest of Ana, prophet of Nidaba; the son of Ukush,\n",
      "patesi of Umma, the prophet of Nidaba; he who was favourably regarded\n",
      "by Ana, the king of the lands; the great patesi of Enlil; endowed with\n",
      "understanding by Enki; whose name was spoken by Babbar (the Sun-god);\n",
      "the chief minister of Enzu (the Moon-god); the representative of\n",
      "Babbar; the patron of Ninni; the son of Nidaba, who was nourished\n",
      "with holy milk by Ninkharsag; the servant of the god Mes, who is the\n",
      "priest of Erech; the pupil of Ninabukhadu, the mistress of Erech; the\n",
      "great minister of the gods.\"[3] Lugal-zaggisi then goes on to state in\n",
      "general terms the limits of his dominion. \"When the god Enlil, the king\n",
      "of the lands,\" he says, \"had bestowed upon Lugal-zaggisi the kingdom\n",
      "of the land, and had granted him success in the eyes of the land, and\n",
      "when his might had cast the lands down, and he had conquered them from\n",
      "the rising of the sun unto the setting of the same, at that time he\n",
      "made straight his path from the Lower Sea (over) the Euphrates and\n",
      "the Tigris[4] unto the Upper Sea. From the rising of the sun unto the\n",
      "setting of the same has Enlil granted him dominion....\"[5] It is to\n",
      "Enlil, the chief of the gods, that, in accordance with the practice\n",
      "of the period, he ascribes the dominion which has been granted him to\n",
      "administer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The phrases in which Lugal-zaggisi defines the limits of his empire\n",
      "are sufficiently striking, and it will be necessary to enquire into\n",
      "their exact significance. But before doing so it will be well to\n",
      "continue quoting from the inscription, which proceeds to describe the\n",
      "benefits which the king has conferred upon different cities of his\n",
      "realm. Referring to the peace and prosperity which characterized\n",
      "Lugal-zaggisi's reign, the record states that \"he caused the lands\n",
      "to dwell in security, he watered the land with waters of joy. In the\n",
      "shrines of Sumer did they set him up to be the patesi of the lands, and\n",
      "in Erech (they appointed him) to be chief priest. At that time he made\n",
      "Erech bright with joy; like a bull he raised the head of Ur to heaven;\n",
      "Larsa, the beloved city of the Sun-god, he watered with waters of joy;\n",
      "Umraa, the beloved city of the god ..., he raised to exalted power; as\n",
      "a ewe that ... her lamb, has he made Ninni-esh resplendent; the summit\n",
      "of Kianki has he raised to heaven.\"[6] Then follows the votive portion\n",
      "of the text and the prayer of dedication, with which for the moment we\n",
      "have no concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the extracts which have been quoted from Lugal-zaggisi's\n",
      "inscription, it will have been seen that he claims a jurisdiction far\n",
      "wider than might have been expected to belong to a patesi of Umma. But\n",
      "the text itself explains the apparent discrepancy, and shows that,\n",
      "while Lugal-zaggisi's inheritance was a patesiate, he won by his own\n",
      "exertions the empire over which he subsequently ruled. It will be\n",
      "noticed that while he claims for himself the titles \"King of Erech\"\n",
      "and \"king of the land,\" _i.e._ of Sumer, he ascribes to his father\n",
      "Ukush only the title \"patesi of Umma.\" It is therefore clear that\n",
      "his father's authority did not reach beyond the limits of his native\n",
      "city, and we may conclude that such was the extent of the patesiate\n",
      "of Umma when Lugal-zaggisi himself came to the throne. The later\n",
      "titles, which he assumes on the vases found at Nippur, prove that at\n",
      "the time they were inscribed he had already established his authority\n",
      "throughout Sumer and had removed his seat of government from Umma to\n",
      "Erech. That the latter city had become his capital is clear from the\n",
      "precedence which he gives to the designation \"King of Erech\" over\n",
      "his other titles of honour; and, in accordance with this change of\n",
      "residence, he details the new relations into which he has entered with\n",
      "the deities of that city. Thus he is the servant of Mes and the pupil\n",
      "of Ninabukhadu, the divine priest and the mistress of Erech; and in\n",
      "a special sense he has become the patron of Ninni, the chief seat\n",
      "of whose worship was at Erech, in her great temple E-anna. Ana, too,\n",
      "the father of the gods, had his temple in Erech, and so Lugal-zaggisi\n",
      "naturally became his priest and enjoyed his special favour. It was\n",
      "probably in consequence of Ana's close connection with his new capital\n",
      "that Lugal-zaggisi ascribes to him the title \"king of the lands,\" which\n",
      "by right belonged only to Enlil of Nippur; and we may note that in the\n",
      "prayer of dedication on the vases it is with Ana that Enlil is besought\n",
      "to intercede on behalf of the king.[7]\n",
      "\n",
      "Although Lugal-zaggisi had changed his capital and no longer continued\n",
      "to use his father's title as patesi of Umma, he naturally did not\n",
      "neglect his native city; moreover, he retained the title \"prophet\n",
      "of Nidaba,\" and thereby continued to claim the protection of the\n",
      "city-goddess, who, before his recent victories, had been his patroness\n",
      "and that of his father before him. He even emphasized his dependence\n",
      "upon her by styling himself her son, and in another passage he boasts\n",
      "that he had raised the city of Umma to power. High in his favour also\n",
      "stood Ur, the city of the Moon-god, and Larsa, the city of the Sun-god;\n",
      "and the less-known cities of Ninni-esh and Kianki are also selected for\n",
      "mention as having been specially favoured by him. At first sight it\n",
      "is not clear on what principle the names of these cities are selected\n",
      "from among all those in the land of Sumer, which were presumably\n",
      "within the circle of his authority. That Erech, Ur, and Larsa should\n",
      "be referred to is natural enough, for they were close to one another,\n",
      "and would thus form the centre and nucleus of his dominion; and the\n",
      "king would naturally devote himself to improving their canalization and\n",
      "beautifying them by the erection of new buildings. It is not improbable\n",
      "that we may explain the mention of Ninni-esh and Kianki on the same\n",
      "principle: they probably stood in the immediate neighbourhood of the\n",
      "three greater cities, or of Umma, and thus participated in the benefits\n",
      "which they enjoyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In any case, the absence of a city's name from Lugal-zaggisi's list\n",
      "is not necessarily to be taken as implying that it was not included\n",
      "within the limits of his dominion. This is proved by the fact that\n",
      "Lagash is not referred to, although it was probably one of his earliest\n",
      "conquests. In fact, the king's object in composing the earlier part\n",
      "of his inscription was not to give an accurate analysis of the extent\n",
      "and condition of his empire, but merely to enumerate the cities he had\n",
      "particularly favoured, and to record the names of those deities with\n",
      "whom he stood in particularly close relations. For instance, we may\n",
      "conclude that although the city of Eridu is not referred to by name,\n",
      "it nevertheless formed part of Lugal-zaggisi's kingdom. There is thus\n",
      "every reason to regard his dominion as having been co-extensive with\n",
      "the whole of Sumer, and his title \"king of the land\" was probably based\n",
      "on a confederation of all the Sumerian city-states.\n",
      "\n",
      "A more difficult problem is presented by what at first sight appears\n",
      "to be a claim to a still wider empire, which follows Lugal-zaggisi's\n",
      "titles at the end of the first and the beginning of the second column\n",
      "of his inscription. He here states that, after Enlil had bestowed on\n",
      "him the kingdom of the land (that is, of Sumer), and had granted him\n",
      "success in the eyes of the land, and when his might had cast the lands\n",
      "down and he had conquered them from East to West, at that time Enlil\n",
      "\"made straight his path from the Lower Sea (over) the Euphrates and the\n",
      "Tigris unto the Upper Sea.\"[8] The Lower Sea is clearly the Persian\n",
      "Gulf, and by the Upper Sea it is probable that the Mediterranean is\n",
      "intended, rather than Lake Urmi or Lake Van. On the basis of this\n",
      "passage Lugal-zaggisi has been credited with having consolidated and\n",
      "ruled an empire extending from the Persian Gulf to the shores of the\n",
      "Mediterranean.[9] In other words, he would have included Akkad and\n",
      "Syria along with Sumer within the limits of his rule.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is true that Shar-Gani-sharri of Akkad, at a rather later period,\n",

      "achievement. For Erech, the capital of his kingdom, was in Southern\n",
      "Babylonia, and, unlike the city of Akkad, was not well adapted to form\n",
      "the centre of an administrative area extending so far to the north and\n",
      "west. Moreover, the actual phrase employed by Lugal-zaggisi does not\n",
      "necessarily imply a claim to dominion within these regions, but may\n",
      "be taken as commemorating little more than a victorious raid, during\n",
      "which he may have penetrated to the Syrian coast. Such an expedition,\n",
      "so far as we know, must have marked a new departure from the policy\n",
      "hitherto followed by the rulers of Sumerian city-states, and its\n",
      "successful prosecution would have fully justified the language in which\n",
      "it is recorded. In view of these considerations, it is preferable\n",
      "to regard Lugal-zaggisi's kingdom, in the strict sense of the word,\n",
      "as having been confined to Sumer. Of his relations to Akkad and the\n",
      "northern cities we have no evidence on which to form an opinion. We\n",
      "shall presently see reasons for believing that at about this period,\n",

      "Babylonia, and, in view of the absence of any reference to it in\n",
      "Lugal-zaggisi's inscription, we may perhaps conclude that in his time\n",
      "the city had already laid the foundations of its later power.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was probably after his successful return from the long expedition\n",
      "in the north-west that Lugal-zaggisi deposited his vases as votive\n",
      "offerings within Enlil's shrine at Nippur, and engraved upon them\n",
      "the inscriptions from which we obtain our information concerning his\n",
      "reign. In the third column of his text he states that he has dedicated\n",
      "them to Enlil, after having made due offerings of loaves in Nippur and\n",
      "having poured out pure water as a libation. He then adds a prayer of\n",
      "dedication, in which he prays for life for himself, and peace for his\n",
      "land, and a large army. \"May Enlil, the king of the lands,\" he says,\n",
      "\"pronounce my prayer to Ana, his beloved father! To my life may he add\n",
      "life! May he cause the lands to dwell in security! Warriors as numerous\n",
      "as the grass may he grant me in abundance! Of the celestial folds may\n",
      "he take care! May he look with kindness on the land (of Sumer)! May\n",
      "the gods not alter the good destiny they have assigned to me! May I\n",

      "warriors \"as numerous as the grass.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It is fortunate for our knowledge of early Sumerian history that the\n",
      "shrine of Enlil at Nippur should have been the depository for votive\n",
      "offerings, brought thither by the rulers of city-states to commemorate\n",
      "their victories. Of the inscribed objects of this class that were\n",
      "recovered at Nippur during the American excavations on that site,\n",
      "by far the most important are the vase-fragments of Lugal-zaggisi,\n",

      "though supplying less detailed information, are of considerable\n",
      "value, since they furnish the names of other rulers of Sumer, who may\n",
      "probably be grouped with Lugal-zaggisi. Two kings of this period are\n",
      "Lugal-kigub-nidudu and Lugal-kisalsi, each of whom bore the title \"King\n",
      "of Erech\" and \"King of Ur,\" while the former, like Lugal-zaggisi,\n",
      "styles himself in addition \"king of the land,\" _i.e._ of Sumer. Their\n",
      "inscriptions were found in the mound of Nippur at about the same\n",
      "level as the vase-fragments of Lugal-zaggisi, and a comparison of the\n",
      "characters employed in each set of texts suggests that they date from\n",
      "about the same period.\n",
      "\n",
      "That Lugal-kigub-nidudu and Lugal-kisalsi are in any case to be\n",
      "set before the time of Shar-Gani-sharri of Akkad is proved by the\n",
      "fact that one of the rough blocks of diorite, which the former had\n",
      "dedicated to Enlil after inscribing his name upon it, was afterwards\n",
      "used by Shar-Gani-sharri as a door-socket in the temple he erected at\n",
      "Nippur.[11] Whether they lived still earlier than Lugal-zaggisi it is\n",
      "difficult to decide. The longest inscription of Lugal-kigub-nidudu\n",
      "which has been recovered is engraved upon a vase which he deposited\n",
      "as a votive offering in Enlil's temple, and from the introductory\n",
      "phrases preceding the dedication it would appear that he founded a\n",
      "kingdom, or at any rate enlarged one which he already possessed. \"When\n",
      "Enlil, the king of the lands,\" the passage runs, \"(had spoken) to\n",
      "Lugal-kigub-nidudu and had addressed a favourable word to him, and had\n",
      "united the dominion with the kingdom, of Erech he made a dominion, of\n",
      "Ur he made a kingdom.\"[12] It would thus seem that Lugal-kigub-nidudu\n",
      "had at first been possessed of only one of the two cities, Erech or Ur,\n",
      "and that he subsequently acquired the other, probably by conquest, and\n",
      "proceeded to rule them both under separate administrations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Too much emphasis is not to be set on the fact that he describes his\n",
      "rule of Erech as a lordship or a dominion, while he styles that of Ur\n",
      "a kingdom; for the difference in these phrases was not very marked in\n",
      "the pre-Sargonic period, and it is to be noted that Erech is mentioned\n",
      "before Ur. Moreover, Lugal-kisalsi assigns the title \"King of Erech\"\n",
      "as well as \"King of Ur\" to his predecessor as to himself, and, since\n",
      "he places the former title first, it is probable that Erech and not Ur\n",
      "was their capital. But even on this assumption it does not follow that\n",
      "Erech was Lugal-kigub-nidudu's native city, for we have seen that when\n",
      "Lugal-zaggisi conquered Sumer he transferred his capital to Erech, and\n",
      "Lugal-kigub-nidudu may have done the same. The fact that at a later\n",
      "period Gudea, when rebuilding the temple E-ninnÃ», came across a stele\n",
      "of Lugal-kisalsi[13] suggests that he exercised authority over Lagash;\n",
      "and we may probably conclude that both he and Lugal-kigub-nidudu\n",
      "included the principal cities of Southern Babylonia under their sway.\n",
      "That Lugal-kisalsi followed and did not precede Lugal-kigub-nidudu\n",
      "upon the dual throne of Erech and Ur is certain from one of his votive\n",
      "inscriptions,[14] which contains a reference to the earlier king. The\n",
      "beginning of the text is wanting, so that it is not clear whether he\n",
      "mentions him as his father or in some other connection. In any case\n",
      "we may assume that he followed him at no long interval; but it is not\n",
      "yet certain whether we are to set their reigns in Sumer before or after\n",

      "The same uncertainty applies to another ruler of this period, who bore\n",

      "\"king of the land.\" Two of his inscriptions have been recovered upon\n",
      "fragments of vases, which were found at Nippur at the same level as\n",
      "those already described, and one of these is of considerable interest,\n",
      "for it gives us the name of an enemy of Sumer who has already bulked\n",
      "largely in the earlier history of Lagash.[15] The inscription in\n",
      "question consists of only a few words, and reads: \"Enshagkushanna has\n",

      "the epithet applied to Kish that at this period, as in the time of\n",
      "Eannatum, the northern city was a terror to the Sumerian states in the\n",
      "south, and we may assume that war between them was not of infrequent\n",
      "occurrence. It was after some successful raid or battle in the north\n",
      "that Enshagkushanna dedicated a portion of the spoil to Enlil in his\n",

      "Although fragments of no less than four of his vase-inscriptions have\n",
      "been discovered,[17] the name of this Sumerian king unfortunately does\n",
      "not occur on any one of them. In the longest of the texts he takes the\n",
      "title of \"king,\" and in the gap that follows we may probably restore\n",
      "the phrase \"of the land,\" that is, of Sumer; on two of them, like the\n",
      "other Sumerian kings we have referred to, he ascribes his installation\n",
      "in the government of the country to Enlil, the god of Nippur. All four\n",
      "inscriptions were drawn up on the same occasion, and commemorate a\n",
      "striking victory this unknown Sumerian ruler had achieved over the\n",
      "northern cities of Kish and Opis. Of the two conquered cities Kish was\n",
      "clearly the more important, for its devastation is recorded in each of\n",
      "the texts, whereas Opis is only mentioned in one of them. Each city was\n",
      "ruled by a separate king, whose overthrow is recorded on the vases,\n",
      "but, since they were defeated in the same battle, we may conjecture\n",
      "that they formed the centre of a single confederation or dominion,\n",
      "of which Kish was the head. In two of the texts the king of Kish is\n",
      "referred to, not only by his title, but by name, and, since he bore the\n",
      "Semitic name of Enbi-Ishtar, we may conclude that at this period Kish,\n",
      "and probably Opis and other northern cities, were already under Semitic\n",
      "domination. In the war these cities were waging with the south, the\n",
      "vases record what appears to have been a serious check to the increase\n",
      "of Semitic influence and power. For not only was Enbi-Ishtar defeated,\n",
      "but both Kish and Opis were sacked, and the Sumerian king returned\n",
      "southward laden with booty, including statues, precious metals, and\n",
      "rare stones. The vases on which he recorded his victory formed part of\n",
      "the spoil captured in the north. They were fashioned of white calcite\n",
      "stalagmite, dark brown sandstone, and dark brown tufa or igneous rock.\n",
      "In the land of Sumer, where stone was a rare commodity, these were\n",
      "highly prized objects, and they formed a fitting thank-offering for\n",
      "presentation at Enlil's shrine.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have already referred to the question as to the nationality of the\n",
      "still earlier kings of Kish, Mesilim and his successors, some of whom\n",
      "we know to have been contemporary with the earlier rulers of Lagash.\n",
      "At that period the northern city had already succeeded in imposing its\n",
      "authority upon some of the city-states of Sumer, and later on both\n",

      "of some of the early kings of Babylonia has long been recognized as\n",
      "having taken place, at any rate from the time of Shar-Gani-sharri; and\n",
      "we have evidence that the honour was not only paid to them after death,\n",
      "but was assumed by the kings themselves during their own lifetime.[22]\n",
      "The occurrence of a proper name such as Ili-Urumush can only be\n",
      "explained on the supposition that a king bearing the name of Urumush\n",
      "had already reigned, or was reigning at the time the former name was\n",
      "employed. Now, the tablet in Constantinople, which mentions the name of\n",
      "Ili-Urumush, is undated, but from its form, writing, and contents it\n",
      "may clearly be assigned to the same epoch as certain dated tablets of\n",
      "Shar-Gani-sharri and NarÃ¢m-Sin with which it was found. From this it\n",
      "follows that Urumush was anterior to Shar-Gani-sharri and NarÃ¢m-Sin,\n",

      "way. We may therefore conclude that both Sippar and Lagash were under\n",
      "the control of Urumush. In other words, it is not improbable that the\n",

      "lead an expedition across the border, is sufficiently noteworthy. The\n",
      "references to Elam which we have hitherto noted in the inscriptions\n",

      "the conditions were reversed, and we shall shortly see reason for\n",
      "believing that his success was not a solitary achievement, but may be\n",
      "connected with other facts in the history of Kish under the Semitic\n",

      "little material on which to base a conjecture. One point, however, may\n",
      "be regarded as certain: the reason for the purchase appears to have had\n",
      "some close connection with the forty-nine new managers and overseers,\n",
      "to whom Manishtusu entrusted the administration of his newly acquired\n",
      "property. The mere fact that their names and descriptions should have\n",
      "been repeated on each side of the obelisk is probably significant.\n",
      "Moreover, they are all described in the text as citizens[30] of Akkad,\n",
      "and the prominence given to them in each section suggests that the\n",
      "king purchased the land with the express object of handing it over to\n",
      "their charge. It may also be noted that Manishtusu removed, not only\n",
      "the former managers, but also every labourer who had been employed on\n",
      "the estates, so that we may assume that the new managers brought their\n",
      "own labourers with them, who would continue the cultivation of the land\n",
      "under their direction. If the king's object in purchasing the land had\n",
      "been merely to make a profitable investment, he would not have removed\n",
      "the former labourers, for whose maintenance he undertook to provide\n",
      "elsewhere. Manishtusu's action can only be explained on the supposition\n",
      "that he was anxious to acquire land on which he might settle the men\n",
      "from Akkad and their adherents. The purchase appears therefore to have\n",
      "been dictated by the necessity of removing certain citizens from Akkad\n",
      "to other sites in Northern Babylonia. We do not know the cause which\n",
      "gave rise to this transference of population, but we shall presently\n",
      "see that, in view of the high social standing of several of the\n",
      "immigrants, Manishtusu's action may perhaps be connected with certain\n",
      "traditions concerning this period which were current in later times.[31]\n",
      "\n",
      "At the head of the inhabitants from Akkad, to whom the king handed over\n",
      "his new estates, stands Aliakhu, his nephew, and among them we also\n",
      "find sons and dependants of the rulers of important cities, who appear\n",
      "to have acknowledged the suzerainty of Kish. Thus two of the men are\n",
      "described as from the household of Kur-shesh, patesi of Umma;[32]\n",
      "another was Ibalum, the son of Ilsu-rabi, patesi of Basime; and a third\n",
      "was Urukagina, son of Engilsa, patesi of Lagash. The reference to the\n",
      "last of these four personages has been employed in an attempt to fix\n",
      "the period of Manishtusu's reign. On the discovery of the obelisk PÃ¨re\n",
      "Scheil proposed that we should identify Urukagina, the son of Engilsa,\n",
      "with the king of Lagash of that name, suggesting that he occupied the\n",
      "position assigned him in the text during his father's lifetime and\n",
      "before he himself succeeded to the throne.[33] At this time it was\n",
      "still the fashion to set Urukagina at the head of the patesis of Tello,\n",
      "and to regard him as the oldest of all the rulers of that city whose\n",
      "names had yet been recovered. Now, on the obelisk mention is also made\n",
      "of a certain \"Me-sa-lim, the son of the king,\"[34] _i.e._ a son of\n",
      "Manishtusu. Support for the proposed identification was therefore found\n",
      "in the further suggestion that Mesalim, the son of Manishtusu, was no\n",
      "other than Mesilim, the early king of Kish, who was the contemporary\n",
      "of Lugal-shag-engur of Lagash, and, in his character of suzerain, had\n",
      "interposed in the territorial dispute between that city and Umma.[35]\n",
      "According to this view, Lagash, under Engilsa and Urukagina, owed\n",
      "allegiance to Kish during the reign of Manishtusu, a state of things\n",
      "which continued into the reign of Mesilim, who, on this theory, was\n",
      "Manishtusu's son and successor.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the recognition of Urukagina's true place in the line of the\n",
      "rulers of Lagash has rendered the theory untenable; and the suggested\n",
      "identification of Mesalim, the son of Manishtusu, with Mesilim,\n",
      "the early king of Kish, so far from giving support to the other\n",
      "proposal, is quite incompatible with it. In fact, both the proposed\n",
      "identifications cannot be right, and it remains to be seen whether\n",
      "either of them can be accepted. Of the two, the proposal to identify\n",
      "Mesalim with Lugal-shag-engur's contemporary may be dismissed at\n",
      "once, since both the internal and the external evidence furnished\n",
      "by the obelisk are against assigning Manishtusu's reign to so early\n",
      "a period. Although these objections do not apply so strongly to the\n",
      "other proposal, its acceptance is negatived on other grounds. From\n",
      "Urukagina's own inscriptions we have seen reason to believe that he\n",
      "did not obtain the throne by right of succession, but by force; he\n",
      "never refers to his own father, and the antagonism to the patesiate,\n",
      "which characterizes his texts, suggests that his reign marks a complete\n",
      "break in the succession.[36] We may therefore conclude that Urukagina\n",
      "of the obelisk is a different personage to Urukagina, the king, and\n",
      "the former's father, Engilsa, would in that case have ruled as a\n",
      "patesi of Lagash at a period subsequent to the sack of that city by\n",
      "Lugal-zaggisi.[37]\n",
      "\n",
      "We are therefore reduced to more general considerations in attempting\n",
      "to fix the date of Manishtusu. That his reign is to be assigned\n",
      "to about the same period as that of Urumush there can be little\n",
      "doubt, for, in contrast to those of the earlier kings of Kish, the\n",
      "inscriptions of both are written in Semitic Babylonian, and the forms\n",
      "of the characters they employ are very similar. Evidence has already\n",
      "been cited which proves that Urumush was anterior to Shar-Gani-sharri\n",
      "and NarÃ¢m-Sin. In Manishtusu, therefore, we have another Semitic king\n",
      "under whom the city of Kish enjoyed the hegemony in Babylonia, which\n",
      "afterwards passed to Akkad. That the kingdom of Kish, under these\n",
      "two rulers, was not separated by a long interval from the empire of\n",
      "Akkad would seem to follow from the references to the latter city on\n",
      "Manishtusu's obelisk.[38] We have already noted that the forty-nine\n",
      "overseers, who were entrusted with the administration of the lands\n",
      "purchased by the king, are described in the text as citizens of Akkad,\n",
      "and that among their number are members of powerful ruling families\n",
      "from other cities of Babylonia. It would thus appear that Akkad was\n",
      "already of sufficient importance to attract princes from such distant\n",
      "cities as Umma and Lagash. This fact, indeed, has been employed as\n",
      "an argument in favour of the view that Manishtusu and Urumush must\n",
      "have ruled after, and not before, Shar-Gani-sharri and NarÃ¢m-Sin,[39]\n",
      "under whom Akkad was made the capital of the whole country. Although\n",
      "this inference does not necessarily follow, and, in point of fact, is\n",
      "contradicted by the evidence already cited with regard to Urumush,\n",
      "it is clear that, even in the time of Manishtusu, the city of Akkad\n",
      "enjoyed a position of considerable importance; and it is improbable\n",
      "that any long period elapsed before it replaced Kish as the capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "The extent of Manishtusu's authority within the limits of Babylonia\n",
      "is indicated by the reference to Southern Babylonian cities in his\n",
      "obelisk-inscription; for, since the patesis of Lagash and Umma sent\n",
      "their relatives or dependants to Manishtusu's court, it may be inferred\n",
      "that his dominions included at least a portion of Sumer as well as\n",
      "Akkad. Like Urumush, he also appears to have undertaken military\n",
      "expeditions, by means of which he added to the territory under his\n",
      "control. In the British Museum are fragments of two monoliths, engraved\n",
      "with duplicate inscriptions, which record his defeat of a confederation\n",
      "of thirty-two kings \"on this side (?) of the sea,\" and the capture of\n",
      "the cities over which they ruled.[40] It is difficult to determine with\n",
      "certainty the region in which these cities lay, but, since \"the sea\"\n",
      "is mentioned without any qualifying phrase, we may probably take it as\n",
      "referring to the Persian Gulf. In that case the text may have recorded\n",
      "the subjugation of the southern portion of Sumer, or perhaps the\n",
      "conquest of cities within the Elamite border. Though Manishtusu's name\n",
      "does not occur in the few lines of the main inscription preserved upon\n",
      "the fragments, there is no doubt that the text is his, for upon one\n",
      "of them is engraved a dedication in rather larger characters, stating\n",
      "that the stele of which it formed a part was dedicated to Shamash\n",
      "by Manishtusu, King of Kish. Since both the fragments were found at\n",
      "AbÃ» Habba, we may conclude that the stelÃ¦ were set up in the great\n",
      "temple at Sippar, and were dedicated by Manishtusu to the Sun-god in\n",
      "commemoration of his victory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other monuments of Manishtusu's reign that have come down to us\n",
      "consist of a number of figures and statues of the king which have been\n",
      "discovered at Susa during the French excavations on that site. There is\n",
      "no doubt that the majority of these were carried to Susa as spoil of\n",
      "war, and were not set up in that city by Manishtusu himself, for they\n",
      "bear Anzanite inscriptions to that effect. Thus one statue is stated\n",
      "to have been brought from Akkad to Susa by Shutruk-nakhkhunte,[41] and\n",
      "another[42] by the same king from \"Ishnunuk,\" incidentally proving that\n",
      "the state of Ashnunnak, which lay to the east of the Tigris, formed\n",
      "part of Manishtusu's dominions.[43] But a more recently discovered\n",
      "statue of the king bears no later Anzanite record, and is inscribed\n",
      "with its original dedication to the god Naruti by a high official in\n",
      "Manishtusu's service.[44] It is a remarkable monument, for while the\n",
      "figure itself is of alabaster, the eyes are formed of white limestone\n",
      "let into sockets and held in place by bitumen; the black pupils are now\n",
      "wanting.[45] Though the staring effect of the inlaid eyes is scarcely\n",
      "pleasing, the statue is undoubtedly the most interesting example of\n",
      "early Semitic sculpture in the round that has yet been recovered. Both\n",
      "in this statue and in the more famous obelisk, PÃ¨re Scheil would see\n",
      "evidence of Manishtusu's permanent subjugation of Elam, in support of\n",
      "his view that Elam and Babylonia practically formed a single country\n",
      "at this early period.[46] But the text inscribed upon the obelisk,\n",
      "as we have already seen,[47] is of a purely local interest, and no\n",
      "object would have been gained by storing such a record at Susa, even\n",
      "on the hypothesis that Manishtusu had transferred his capital thither.\n",
      "It is safer therefore to draw no historical conclusions from the\n",
      "_provenance_ of the statue and the obelisk, but to class them with\n",
      "the other statues which we know to have been carried off as spoil\n",
      "to Elam at a later period. There is evidence that Manishtusu, like\n",
      "Urumush, carried on a successful war with Elam,[48] but it is probable\n",
      "that the successes of both kings were of the nature of victorious\n",
      "raids and were followed up by no permanent occupation of the country.\n",
      "The early existence of Semitic influence in Elam is amply attested\n",
      "by the employment of the Semitic Babylonian language for their own\n",
      "inscriptions by native Elamite rulers such as Basha-Shushinak.[49] But\n",
      "it does not necessarily follow that the inscriptions of native kings of\n",
      "Babylonia, which have been found at Susa, were deposited there by these\n",
      "kings themselves during a period of Semitic rule in Elam. In fact, it\n",
      "was probably not until the period of the Dynasty of Ur that Elam was\n",

      "The discovery which has reopened the question as to the identity of\n",

      "one of the most valuable specimens of early Babylonian sculpture that\n",
      "has yet been found. Two portions of the stone have been recovered,\n",
      "engraved with sculptures and bearing traces of an inscription of an\n",
      "early Semitic king of Babylonia. The stone is roughly triangular in\n",
      "shape, the longest side being curved, and on all three sides reliefs\n",
      "are sculptured in two registers. In the upper register are battle\n",
      "scenes and a row of captives, and in the lower are representations\n",
      "of the king and his suite. On the third face of the monolith, to the\n",
      "right of the king in the lower register, is a scene in which vultures\n",
      "are represented feeding on the slain; and on a smaller detached\n",
      "fragment of the stone is a figure, probably that of a god, clubbing\n",
      "the king's enemies who are caught in a net. The details of the net\n",
      "and the vultures obviously recall the similar scenes on the stele of\n",
      "Eannatum,[20] but the treatment of the birds and also of the figures in\n",
      "the battle scenes, is said to be far more varied and less conventional\n",
      "than in Eannatum's sculpture. That they are Semitic and not Sumerian\n",
      "work is proved by the Semitic inscription, of which a few phrases of\n",
      "the closing imprecations are still visible. The king also has the long\n",
      "pointed beard of the Semites, descending to his girdle, and, although\n",
      "his clothing has Sumerian characteristics, he is of the Semitic type.\n",
      "Several points of interest are suggested by details of the sculpture,\n",
      "and to these we will presently refer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The point which now concerns us is the name of the king to whom we\n",
      "owe this remarkable monument. Although the main inscription has\n",
      "unfortunately been hammered out, the king's name has been preserved\n",
      "in a cartouche in front of him, where he is termed \"Sharru-Gi, the\n",
      "king.\" Now Sharru-GI is practically identical with Sharru-GI-NA, one\n",
      "of the two forms under which Sargon's name is written in Assyrian and\n",
      "Neo-Babylonian texts[21]; for the sign NA in the latter name is merely\n",
      "a phonetic complement to the ideogram and could be dropped in writing\n",
      "without affecting in any way the pronunciation of the name. Hitherto,\n",
      "as we have seen, Sargon, the traditional father of NarÃ¢m-Sin, has been\n",
      "identified with Shar-Gani-sharri of Akkad. The question obviously\n",
      "suggests itself: Can we identify the Sharru-Gi of the new monument\n",
      "with Shar-Gani-sharri? Can we suppose that a contemporary scribe\n",
      "invented this rendering of Shar-Gani-sharri's name, and thus gave rise\n",
      "to the form which we find preserved in later Babylonian and Assyrian\n",
      "tradition? PÃ¨re Scheil, who was the first to offer a solution of the\n",
      "problem, is clearly right in treating Sharru-Gi and Shar-Gani-sharri as\n",
      "different personages; the forms are too dissimilar to be regarded as\n",
      "variants of the same name. It has also been noted that Sharru-Gi and\n",
      "NarÃ¢m-Sin are both mentioned on a tablet from Tello. On these grounds\n",
      "PÃ¨re Scheil suggested that Sharru-Gi, whose name he would render as\n",
      "Sharru-ukÃ®n (=Sargon), was the father of NarÃ¢m-Sin, as represented\n",
      "in the late tradition; Shar-Gani-sharri he would regard as another\n",
      "sovereign of Akkad, of the same dynasty as Sargon and NarÃ¢m-Sin and one\n",
      "of their successors on the throne.[22]\n",
      "\n",
      "It may be admitted that this explanation is one that at first sight\n",
      "seems to commend itself, for it appears to succeed in reconciling the\n",
      "later tradition with the early monuments. But difficulties in the way\n",
      "of its acceptance were at once pointed out.[23] The occurrence of the\n",
      "proper name Sharru-Gi-ili, \"Sharru-Gi is my god,\" on the Obelisk of\n",
      "Manishtusu clearly proves that a king bearing the name of Sharru-Gi,\n",
      "and presumably identical with the Sharru-Gi of the new stele, preceded\n",
      "Manishtusu, king of Kish, for the deification of a king could obviously\n",
      "only take place during his lifetime or after his death.[24] Similar\n",
      "evidence has already been cited to prove that Urumush of Kish was\n",
      "anterior to Shar-Gani-sharri and NarÃ¢m-Sin, though his reign may not\n",
      "have been separated from theirs by any long interval.[25] Granting\n",
      "these conclusions, if NarÃ¢m-Sin had been the son of Sharru-Gi, as\n",
      "suggested by PÃ¨re Scheil, Urumush would have been separated from\n",
      "Manishtusu by the Dynasty of Akkad, a combination that is scarcely\n",
      "probable. Moreover, the context of the passage on the tablet from\n",
      "Tello, on which the names of Sharru-Gi and NarÃ¢m-Sin are mentioned,\n",
      "though of doubtful interpretation, does not necessarily imply that\n",
      "they were living at the same time; they may have been separated by\n",
      "several generations. These reasons in themselves make it probable\n",
      "that Sharru-Gi was not the founder of NarÃ¢m-Sin's dynasty, but was a\n",
      "predecessor of Manishtusu and Urumush upon the throne of Kish.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has been further pointed out that in an inscription preserved in the\n",
      "Imperial Ottoman Museum at Constantinople the name of a king of Kish is\n",
      "mentioned, which, to judge from the traces still visible, may probably\n",
      "be restored as that of Sharru-GI.[26] The fragmentary nature of the\n",
      "text, which was found at AbÃ» Habba during the excavations conducted\n",
      "by the Turkish Government upon that site,[27] rendered any deductions\n",
      "that might be drawn from it uncertain; but it sufficed to corroborate\n",
      "the suggestion that Sharru-Gi was not a king of Akkad, but a still\n",
      "earlier king of Kish. Since then I have recognized a duplicate text of\n",
      "the Constantinople inscription, also from AbÃ» Habba, which enables us\n",
      "to supplement and to some extent correct the conclusions based upon\n",
      "it. The duplicate consists of a cruciform stone object, inscribed on\n",
      "its twelve sides with a votive text recording a series of gifts to\n",
      "the Sun-god Shamash and his consort Aa in the city of Sippar, and the\n",
      "early part of its text corresponds to the fragmentary inscription at\n",
      "Constantinople. Unfortunately the beginning of the text is wanting, as\n",
      "is the case with the Constantinople text, so that we cannot decide with\n",
      "certainty the name of the king who had the monument engraved. But the\n",
      "duplicate furnishes fresh data on which to base a conclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the king's name is wanting, it is possible to estimate the\n",
      "amount of text that is missing at the head of the first column, and it\n",
      "is now clear that the name of Sharru-Gi does not occur at the beginning\n",
      "of the inscription, but some lines down the column; in other words, its\n",
      "position suggests a name in a genealogy rather than that of the writer\n",
      "of the text. Moreover, in a broken passage in the second column the\n",
      "name Sharru-GI occurs again, and the context proves definitely that\n",
      "he was not the writer of the text, who speaks in the first person,\n",
      "though he may not improbably have been his father. But, although the\n",
      "monument can no longer be ascribed to Sharru-GI, the titles \"the mighty\n",
      "king, the king of Kish,\" which occur in the first column of the text,\n",
      "are still to be taken as applying to him, while the occurrence of the\n",
      "name in the second column confirms its suggested restoration in the\n",
      "genealogy. It may therefore be regarded as certain that Sharru-GI was\n",
      "an early king of Kish, and, it would seem, the father of the king\n",
      "who had the cruciform monument inscribed and deposited as a votive\n",
      "offering in the temple of Shamash at Sippar. In the last chapter\n",
      "reference has been made to Manishtusu's activity in Sippar and his\n",
      "devotion to the great temple of the Sun-god in that city.[28] For\n",
      "various epigraphical reasons, based on a careful study of its text,\n",
      "I would provisionally assign the cruciform monument to Manishtusu.\n",
      "According to this theory, Sharru-GI would be Manishtusu's father,\n",
      "and the earliest king of Kish of this period whose name has yet been\n",
      "recovered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proof that Sharru-Gi, or, according to the later interpretation\n",
      "of the name, Sargon, was not identical with Shar-Gani-sharri, King\n",
      "of Akkad, nor was even a member of his dynasty, would seem to bring\n",
      "once more into discredit the later traditions which gathered round his\n",
      "name. To the Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian scribes Sargon appears as a\n",
      "king of Agade, or Akkad, and the father of NarÃ¢m-Sin, who succeeded\n",
      "him upon his throne. It is clear, therefore, that the name of the\n",
      "earlier king of Kish has been borrowed for the king of Akkad, whose\n",
      "real name, Shar-Gani-sharri, has disappeared in the tradition. Are\n",
      "we to imagine that the great achievements, which later ages ascribed\n",
      "to Sargon of Akkad, were also borrowed along with his name from the\n",
      "historical Sargon of Kish? Or is it possible that the traditional\n",
      "Sargon is representative of his period, and combines in his one person\n",
      "the attributes of more than one king? In the cruciform monument,\n",
      "which we have seen may probably be assigned to Manishtusu, the king\n",
      "prefaces the account of his conquest of Anshan by stating that it took\n",
      "place at a time \"when all the lands ... revolted against me,\" and the\n",
      "phrase employed recalls the similar expression in the Neo-Babylonian\n",

      "referred to Shar-Gani-sharri and treated as historically true.\n",
      "\n",
      "We obtain a very similar result when we employ the same method of\n",
      "testing Sargon's Elamite campaigns. The Omen-tablet opens with the\n",
      "record of Sargon's invasion of the country, followed by his conquest\n",
      "of the Elamites, whom he is related to have afflicted grievously by\n",
      "cutting off their food supplies.[31] This would appear to have been\n",
      "in the nature of a successful raid into Elamite territory. On the\n",
      "other hand, one of the early account-tablets is dated in the year when\n",
      "Shar-Gani-sharri overcame the expedition which Elam and Zakhara had\n",
      "sent against Opis and Sakli.[32] It is clear that the date, although it\n",
      "records a success against the Elamites, can hardly refer to the same\n",
      "event as the Omen-text, since the latter records an invasion of Elam\n",
      "by Sargon, not a raid into Babylonian territory by the Elamites. But\n",
      "the contemporary document at least proves that Shar-Gani-sharri was\n",
      "successful in his war with Elam, and it is not unlikely that the attack\n",
      "on Opis by the Elamites provoked his invasion of their country.[33]\n",
      "Such a raid as the Omens describe fully accords with the practice of\n",
      "this period, when the kings of Kish and Akkad used to invade Elam and\n",
      "return to their own country laden with spoil.[34] The date-formula\n",
      "which confirms a third point in the late tradition refers to the\n",
      "year in which Shar-Gani-sharri laid the foundations of the temple of\n",
      "Anunitu and the temple of Amal in Babylon,[35] proving not only that\n",
      "the city of Babylon was in existence at this period, but also that\n",
      "Sargon devoted himself to its adornment by building temples there. The\n",
      "late Chronicle records that Sargon removed the soil from the trenches\n",
      "of Babylon,[36] and a broken passage in the Omens appears to state\n",
      "that he increased the might of Babylon.[37] On this point the early\n",
      "date-formula and the late tradition confirm and supplement each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, wherever we can test the achievements ascribed to Sargon of Akkad\n",
      "by comparison with contemporary records of Shar-Gani-sharri's reign,\n",
      "we find a complete agreement between them. Another feature in the\n",
      "traditional picture of Sargon admirably suits the founder of a dynasty\n",
      "at Akkad, whereas it would have little suitability to a king of Kish.\n",
      "This is the support which the goddess Ishtar is stated to have given\n",
      "Sargon, both in raising him to the throne and in guiding his arms to\n",
      "victory.[38] For Akkad, which Shar-Gani-sharri made his capital, was\n",
      "an important seat of her worship. When, therefore, the late tradition\n",
      "records that Sargon conquered Subartu and Kazallu, we may ascribe these\n",
      "victories to Shar-Gani-sharri, although they are unrecorded in the\n",
      "contemporary monuments that have as yet been recovered. At any time\n",
      "it may happen that the name of Kashtubila of Kazallu may be found in\n",
      "a text of Shar-Gani-sharri's reign, as that of Mannu-dannu of Magan\n",
      "has been recovered on a statue of NarÃ¢m-Sin.[39] Such an attitude of\n",
      "expectancy is justified by the striking instances in which the late\n",
      "tradition has already been confirmed by the early texts; and the\n",
      "parallelism in the language of Manishtusu's monument and the late\n",
      "Chronicle of Sargon, to which reference has been made, must be treated\n",
      "as fortuitous. Having regard to the insecure foundations upon which\n",
      "these early empires were based, Shar-Gani-sharri, like Manishtusu, may\n",
      "well have had to face a revolt of the confederation of cities he had\n",
      "subjected to his rule. In such a case the scribe of Shar-Gani-sharri\n",
      "would probably have employed phraseology precisely similar to that in\n",
      "Manishtusu's text, for conventional forms of expression constantly\n",
      "recur in monumental inscriptions of the same period.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our conclusion, therefore, is that in the later texts Shar-Gani-sharri\n",
      "has adopted Sharru-Gi's name, but nothing more. In view of the general\n",
      "accuracy of the late traditions concerning the conquests of these\n",
      "early rulers, it may seem strange that such a change of names should\n",
      "have taken place; but it is not difficult to suggest causes for the\n",
      "confusion. Both kings were great conquerors, both belonged to the same\n",
      "epoch, and founded dynasties in Northern Babylonia,[40] and both bore\n",
      "names which, in part, are not dissimilar. Moreover, the suggestion\n",
      "has been made that the words \"Gani\" and \"Gi,\" which form components\n",
      "of the names, may possibly have both been divine titles,[41] though\n",
      "we find no trace of them in the later periods of history. But whether\n",
      "this was so or not, and whatever renderings of the names we adopt,[42]\n",
      "it is clear that Sargon's traditional achievements may be credited to\n",
      "Shar-Gani-Sharri, who, as king of Agade or Akkad, succeeded to the\n",
      "earlier empire of the kings of Kish.[43]\n",
      "\n",
      "We have already seen reason to believe that the kings of Kish were\n",
      "separated by no long interval from the empire of Akkad,[44] and\n",
      "this view is supported, not only by a study of their inscriptions,\n",
      "but also by the close connection that may be traced between the\n",
      "artistic achievements of the two periods. Epigraphic evidence has\n",
      "been strikingly reinforced by the discovery of Sharru-Gi's monolith;\n",
      "for the sculptures upon it share to some extent the high artistic\n",
      "qualities which have hitherto been regarded as the exclusive possession\n",
      "of the Dynasty of Akkad. The modelling of the figures on NarÃ¢m-Sin's\n",
      "stele of victory,[45] their natural pose and spirited attitudes, have\n",
      "long been recognized as belonging to a totally different category\n",
      "from the squat and conventional representations upon the Stele of the\n",
      "Vultures. The cylinder-seals of the period are marked by the same\n",
      "degree of excellence, but between the sculptures of Eannatum and those\n",
      "of NarÃ¢m-Sin there has hitherto been a gap in the orderly stages of\n",
      "development. A single example of engraved metal-work had indeed been\n",
      "recovered, but the date of this was, and still is, to some extent\n",
      "uncertain. The object consists of the copper head of a colossal votive\n",
      "lance, some thirty-one and a half inches long. On one of its faces is\n",
      "engraved in spirited outline the figure of a lion rampant, and on the\n",
      "neck of the blade is the name of a king of Kish beginning with the sign\n",
      "\"Sharru.\" A slight indication of date is afforded by the fact that it\n",
      "was found at Tello, near the eastern corner of Ur-NinÃ¢'s building, but\n",
      "at a rather higher level.[46] If the second line of the inscription,\n",
      "which is illegible through oxidization, contained a title and not part\n",
      "of the name, it is probable that we may restore the name in the first\n",
      "line as that of Sharru-Gi himself. Otherwise we must assign the lance\n",
      "to some other king of Kish, but whether we should place him before or\n",
      "after Sharru-Gi it is difficult to say.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "It was clear that the art of the later period was ultimately based upon\n",
      "the formal though decorative conventions of the earlier Sumerian time,\n",
      "but, with the doubtful exception of the copper lance-head and the rude\n",
      "statues of Manishtusu, no example had previously been found of the\n",
      "intermediate period. The missing link between the earlier sculpture\n",
      "of Lagash and that of Akkad has now been supplied by the monolith of\n",
      "Sharru-Gi. Its points of resemblance to the Vulture Stele, both in\n",
      "design and treatment, prove direct continuity with early Sumerian art.\n",
      "The divine net and the vultures were obviously borrowed from the Tello\n",
      "monument, while the guards attending upon Sharru-Gi display the squat\n",
      "and heavy appearance which characterizes the warriors of Eannatum.\n",
      "At the same time, a new element is introduced in the battle scenes,\n",
      "where the designs and grouping are more varied and less conventional.\n",
      "Here the sculptor has allowed his fancy freer play, and has attempted\n",
      "a naturalistic treatment in his delineation of the combatants. He has\n",
      "not fully attained the masterly qualities which characterize the stele\n",
      "of NarÃ¢m-Sin, but his work is its direct forerunner. To judge from the\n",
      "striking evidence furnished by a single monument, the art of Kish must\n",
      "have been closely related to that of Akkad. The latter inaugurated no\n",
      "totally new departure, but was dependent on its predecessor, whose most\n",
      "striking qualities it adopted and improved.\n",
      "\n",
      "As in the sphere of art, so, too, in that of politics and government,\n",
      "the Dynasty of Akkad did not originate, but merely expanded and\n",
      "developed its inheritance along lines already laid down. Even with\n",
      "Sharru-Gi, it is clear that we have not reached the beginning of the\n",
      "Semitic movement in Northern Babylonia, and that in this respect\n",
      "the kingdom of Kish resembled the later empire of Akkad. The battle\n",
      "scenes upon his monuments prove that Sharru-Gi was a great conqueror,\n",
      "but the traces of the text supply no details of his campaigns. It\n",
      "is significant, however, that his enemies are bearded Semites, not\n",
      "Sumerians, proving that the Semitic immigration into Northern Babylonia\n",
      "and the surrounding districts was no new thing; we may infer that\n",
      "kindred tribes had long been settled in this portion of Western Asia,\n",
      "and were prepared to defend their territory from the encroachments of\n",
      "one of their own race. Yet details of Sharru-Gi's sculpture prove that\n",
      "with him we are appreciably nearer to the time of Sumerian domination\n",
      "in the north. The shaven faces of the king's suite or body-guard\n",
      "suggest Sumerians, and their clothing, which the king himself shares,\n",
      "is also of that type. In such details we may see evidence of strong\n",
      "Sumerian influence, either in actual life or in artistic convention.\n",
      "Such a mixture of Sumerian and Semitic characteristics would be quite\n",
      "foreign to the Dynasty of Akkad, and it is probable that the earlier\n",
      "rulers of Kish had not yet proved themselves superior to Sumerian\n",
      "tutelage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some account has already been given in the last chapter of the\n",
      "campaigns of Manishtusu and Urumush, which paved the way for the\n",
      "conquests of Shar-Gani-sharri. We there saw that Manishtusu claims to\n",
      "have defeated a confederation of thirty-two cities,[47] and, if we are\n",
      "right in assigning the cruciform monument to him, we have definite\n",
      "proof that his successes were not confined to Akkad and Sumer, but\n",
      "were carried beyond the Elamite border. Since the fragments of his\n",
      "stelÃ¦, like the cruciform monument itself, were found at Sippar, where\n",
      "they had been dedicated in the great temple of the Sun-god, it is\n",
      "quite possible that they should be employed to supplement each other\n",
      "as having commemorated the same campaign. In that case, the kings\n",
      "of the thirty-two cities are to be regarded as having inaugurated\n",
      "\"the revolt of all the lands,\" which the cruciform monument tells us\n",
      "preceded the conquest of Anshan. The leader of the revolt was clearly\n",
      "the king of Anshan, since the cruciform monument and its duplicate\n",

      "the campaign, laden with gifts and tribute, Manishtusu led the king\n",
      "as his captive into the presence of Shamash, whose temple he lavishly\n",
      "enriched in gratitude for his victory. His boast that he ruled, as well\n",
      "as conquered, Anshan was probably based on the exaction of tribute;\n",
      "the necessity for the reconquest of Elam by Urumush, and later on by\n",
      "Shar-Gani-sharri would seem to indicate that the authority of these\n",
      "early Semitic kings in Elam was acknowledged only so long as their army\n",
      "was in occupation of the country.[48]\n",
      "\n",
      "Already, in the reign of Manishtusu, Akkad and her citizens had\n",
      "enjoyed a position of great influence in the kingdom of Kish, and it\n",
      "is not surprising that in the course of a few generations she should\n",
      "have obtained the hegemony in Babylonia. We do not know the immediate\n",
      "cause of the change of capital, nor whether it was the result of a\n",
      "prolonged period of antagonism between the rival cities. On this point\n",
      "the later tradition is silent, merely recording that Sargon obtained\n",
      "\"the kingdom\" through Ishtar's help. That Shar-Gani-sharri was the\n",
      "actual founder of his dynasty is clear from the inscription upon his\n",
      "gate-sockets found at Nippur, which ascribe no title to his father,\n",
      "DÃ¢ti-Enlil,[49] proving that his family had not even held the patesiate\n",
      "or governorship of Akkad under the suzerainty of Kish. Indeed,\n",
      "tradition related that Sargon's native city was AzupirÃ¢nu, and it\n",
      "loved to contrast his humble birth and upbringing with the subsequent\n",
      "splendour of his reign. The legend of his committal to the river in an\n",
      "ark of bulrushes, and of his rescue and adoption by Akki, the gardener,\n",
      "would make its appeal to every later generation, and it undoubtedly\n",
      "ensured for Sargon the position of a national hero in the minds of the\n",
      "people. The association of the story with his name, while tending to\n",
      "preserve his memory, need not be held to discredit the traditions of\n",
      "his conquests, which, as we have already seen, are confirmed in several\n",
      "important details by the inscriptions of his reign.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the transference of power from Kish to Akkad an expansion of\n",
      "Semitic authority from Northern Babylonia appears to have taken place\n",
      "throughout a considerable portion of Western Asia. Elam no longer\n",
      "claims the principal share of attention from the rulers of Akkad and\n",
      "Sumer, and Shar-Gani-sharri seems to have devoted his energies to\n",

      "on the east of the Lower ZÃ¢b, was conquered in the same year that\n",

      "Dynasty of Akkad, such as we have recovered for the later Dynasties of\n",
      "Ur and Babylon, and the dated tablets of this period are too few to\n",

      "conquests in the order in which they took place, or of tracing the\n",
      "steps by which he gradually increased his empire. But if the order of\n",
      "the sections on the Omen-tablet has any significance, it would seem\n",
      "that his most important conquest, that of Amurru or \"the Western Land,\"\n",
      "took place in the earlier years of his reign.\n",
      "\n",
      "A discrepancy occurs in the later accounts of this conquest, which have\n",
      "come down to us upon the Omen-tablet and the Neo-Babylonian Chronicle.\n",
      "While in the former the complete subjugation of Amurru is recorded to\n",
      "have taken place \"in the third year,\" the latter states that this event\n",
      "occurred \"in the eleventh year.\" It is quite possible to reconcile the\n",
      "two traditions; the former statement may imply that it took three years\n",
      "to subdue the country, the latter that the conquest was achieved in the\n",
      "eleventh year of Shar-Gani-sharri's reign.[51] Indeed, the fact that\n",
      "four sections of the Omens refer to Amurru would seem to imply that it\n",
      "required several expeditions to bring the whole region into complete\n",
      "subjection. By the extension of his authority to the Mediterranean\n",
      "coast Shar-Gani-sharri made a striking advance upon the ideals of\n",
      "empire possessed by his predecessors on the throne of Kish. But even in\n",
      "this achievement he was only following in the steps of a still earlier\n",
      "ruler. A passage in Lugal-zaggisi's text would seem to imply that,\n",
      "in the course of an expedition along the Euphrates, he had succeeded\n",
      "in penetrating to the Syrian coast.[52] But Shar-Gani-sharri's\n",
      "conquest appears to have been of a more permanent character than\n",
      "Lugal-zaggisi's raid. The position of his capital rendered it easier to\n",
      "maintain permanent relations with the West, and to despatch punitive\n",
      "expeditions thither in the event of his authority being called in\n",
      "question.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has been claimed on behalf of Shar-Gani-sharri that he did not\n",
      "stop at the coast, but crossed the Mediterranean to Cyprus, which he\n",
      "is said to have included within the limits of his empire. It would\n",
      "seem, however, that while the island may have been subject indirectly\n",
      "to Babylonian influence at an early period, there is no indication\n",
      "of any direct or vigorous Semitic influence upon the native Cypriote\n",
      "culture at this time.[53] But traces of such an influence we should\n",
      "expect to find, if the island had been politically subject to\n",
      "Shar-Gani-sharri, and had shared the elaborate system of communication\n",
      "which he established between the distant parts of his empire. In itself\n",
      "the archaeological evidence would scarcely have been cited to prove a\n",
      "definite occupation of the island, had not a statement occurred upon\n",
      "Sargon's Omen-tablet to the effect that \"he crossed the Sea of the\n",
      "West.\" But the newly discovered chronicle proves that the true reading\n",
      "should be \"the Sea in the East,\" which without doubt indicates the\n",
      "Persian Gulf.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the Chronicle we gather that in the original composition this\n",
      "passage was not cast in the form of a consecutive narrative. It is a\n",
      "poetical summary of Sargon's might, elaborating in greater detail the\n",
      "preceding phrase that \"he poured out his glory over the world.\" In\n",
      "it the clauses are balanced in antithesis, and the Western Land and\n",
      "the Eastern Sea, that is Syria and the Persian Gulf, are mentioned\n",
      "together as having formed the extreme limits of Sargon's empire. On\n",
      "the Omen-tablet the original text has been cut up into sections and\n",
      "applied piecemeal to different augural phenomena. In its new setting\n",
      "as a consecutive narrative of events the mention of the Persian Gulf\n",
      "was obviously inconsistent with the conquest of Amurru, and hence\n",
      "it was natural for a copyist to amend the text to the form in which\n",
      "it has reached us on the Omen-tablet.[54] The Omens still retained\n",
      "the reference to the despoiling of the Country of the Sea, _i.e._\n",
      "the littoral of the Persian Gulf, which Shar-Gani-sharri doubtless\n",
      "included within the southern border of his empire. With this record\n",
      "we may connect the tradition, reproduced in the Legend of Sargon,\n",
      "that he conquered Dilmun, an island in the Persian Gulf, and with his\n",
      "maritime enterprise in this region we may compare that of Sennacherib\n",
      "at a later date who crossed the Gulf in the course of his conquest of\n",
      "Elam. From the earliest periods we know that the rivers and canals\n",
      "of Babylonia were navigated,[55] and the Persian Gulf was a natural\n",
      "outlet for the trade of the Sumerian cities in the south. In organizing\n",
      "a naval expedition for the conquest of the coast and the islands,\n",
      "Shar-Gani-sharri would have had native ships and sailors at his\n",
      "disposal, whose knowledge of the Gulf had been acquired in the course\n",
      "of their regular coastal trading.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the internal administration of his empire Shar-Gani-sharri appears\n",
      "to have inaugurated, or at any rate to have organized, a regular\n",
      "system of communication between the principal cities and the capital.\n",
      "The references to separate cities, which occur in the contemporary\n",
      "inscriptions of his reign, are not numerous. From the texts found at\n",

      "the shakkanakku or grand vizir, the magician of the royal household,\n",
      "and the king's cup-bearer. The seals were obviously employed by the\n",
      "officials whose names occur in the second part of each inscription, the\n",
      "name of the king being also included to give them the royal authority.\n",
      "The right to use the royal name was evidently a privilege enjoyed only\n",
      "by the higher officials of the court.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the fact that the broken lumps of clay were found at Tello, it\n",
      "is clear that the sealed bundles had been despatched thither from\n",
      "Akkad, and we have in them incontestable evidence of a service of\n",
      "convoys between Akkad and Lagash, under the direct control of the\n",
      "king's officers. We may note that in addition to the seal-impressions\n",
      "several of the clay fragments were inscribed in a cursive hand with\n",
      "the name of an official, or private person, for whom the sealed\n",
      "packet was intended. Thus a sealed bundle from the grand vizir was\n",
      "addressed \"To Alla,\" that from Dada, the magician, \"To Lugal-ushumgal,\"\n",
      "whose name occurs in the seal on other fragments; while one sent in\n",
      "NarÃ¢m-Sin's reign appears to have been addressed simply \"To Lagash,\"\n",
      "indicating the packet's place of destination. Apart from the fact\n",
      "that, with the exception of Lugal-ushumgal, the high court-officials\n",
      "mentioned on the seals would naturally be living in Akkad, not in\n",
      "Lagash, the addresses on the different fragments, particularly the one\n",
      "last referred to, definitely prove that the sealings were employed on\n",
      "bundles actually despatched from city to city and not stored in any\n",
      "archive or repository. It is therefore certain that, during the reigns\n",
      "of Shar-Gani-sharri and NarÃ¢m-Sin, a regular system of communication\n",
      "was kept up between Lagash and the court, and it may legitimately be\n",
      "inferred that the capital was linked up in a similar way to the other\n",
      "great cities of the empire.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the system of official convoys, the commercial tablets\n",
      "of this period that have been found at Tello bear witness to an active\n",
      "interchange of goods and produce between Lagash, Akkad, and other\n",
      "cities in the empire.[60] Thus in some we read of the despatch of gold\n",
      "to Akkad, or of herds of oxen, or flocks of sheep, lambs and goats.\n",
      "In return we find Akkad sent grain and dates southwards, and probably\n",
      "garments and woven stuffs; the importance of the first two exports is\n",
      "indicated by the frequent occurrence of the expressions \"grain of Akkad\"\n",
      "and \"dates of Akkad\" in the commercial texts. Moreover, a study of\n",
      "the proper names occurring on the tablets suggests that, in consequence\n",
      "of these commercial relations, a considerable Semitic immigration now\n",
      "took place from Akkad and the north. Among southern Sumerian cities\n",
      "Erech and Umma, Ninni-esh and Adab had particularly close relations\n",
      "with Lagash, while goods despatched from Kish, Nippur, and Ur are\n",
      "invoiced in the lists. The conquests of Shar-Gani-sharri and NarÃ¢m-Sin\n",
      "were also reflected in the articles of commerce that reached the market\n",
      "of Lagash, where contributions from Magan, Melukhkha, and Elam were\n",
      "not infrequently met with, and we even find the sale of slaves from\n",
      "such distant countries as Gutiu and Amurru recorded. To regulate the\n",
      "trade relations between the different cities, and to instruct his local\n",
      "officials on details of their administration, it is probable that the\n",
      "kings of Akkad, like those of the First Dynasty of Babylon, wrote\n",
      "letters and despatches which were delivered by royal messengers. Though\n",
      "no royal letters have been found inscribed with the regular epistolary\n",
      "formulÃ¦, a few tablets of the period contain what are obviously\n",
      "directions from the king.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was probably due to his encouragement of official and commercial\n",
      "intercourse between the scattered cities over which he ruled, that\n",
      "Shar-Gani-sharri was enabled to establish an efficient control over\n",
      "an empire which was more extensive than that of any earlier ruler. A\n",
      "study of the names upon the Obelisk of Manishtusu makes it clear that,\n",
      "already under the kings of Kish, the barriers which had previously\n",
      "surrounded and isolated each city-state had begun to disappear under\n",
      "the influence of a central administration. This process was accelerated\n",
      "in Shar-Gani-sharri's reign, and, although under the kings of Ur\n",
      "and Isin a conservative reaction appears to have set in, the great\n",
      "cities never returned to their former state of isolation even in the\n",
      "south. Another factor, which may have contributed to this process of\n",
      "centralization, may probably be traced in Manishtusu's text itself, and\n",
      "echoes of it may perhaps be detected in some of the later traditions\n",
      "of Sargon's reign. It will be remembered that the obelisk records the\n",
      "purchase by the king of some large landed estates in the neighbourhood\n",
      "of Kish and three other cities in Northern Babylonia, on which he\n",
      "intended to settle certain citizens of Akkad and their adherents.[61]\n",
      "This wholesale transference of a large section of the population of\n",
      "a city may well have been dictated by political motives, and it is\n",
      "possible that it was part of a general system, inaugurated by the kings\n",
      "of Kish with the object of substituting national feeling in place of\n",
      "the local patriotism of the city-state. According to this theory,\n",
      "Manishtusu's object would have been to weaken Akkad by the deportation\n",
      "of many of her principal citizens to the neighbourhood of Kish.\n",
      "\n",
      "The high social standing of several of the immigrants, whose names\n",
      "are enumerated on the obelisk, suggests a comparison with the late\n",
      "traditions concerning Sargon's high-handed treatment of \"the sons of\n",
      "his palace.\"[62] The Neo-Babylonian Chronicle relates that Sargon\n",
      "caused \"the sons of his palace,\" that is his relatives and personal\n",
      "attendants, to settle for five _kasgid_ around, and it adds that over\n",
      "the hosts of the world he reigned supreme. The Omen-tablet represents\n",
      "certain nobles, or powerful adherents of the king, as having been\n",
      "dispossessed of their dwellings in consequence of additions made to the\n",
      "royal palace; and they are recorded to have appealed to Sargon to tell\n",
      "them where they should go. It is quite possible that these episodes\n",
      "in the Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian texts had some such historical\n",
      "basis as that suggested in the preceding paragraph. Shar-Gani-sharri\n",
      "may have adopted Manishtusu's policy and carried it out on a more\n",
      "extensive scale. The deportations from Akkad, referred to in the late\n",
      "tradition, may have been intended to strengthen the loyal elements in\n",
      "the provinces. In the course of centuries the motive which prompted the\n",
      "movement would be forgotten or misunderstood, and it would be ascribed\n",
      "to some such material cause as an increase in the size of the royal\n",
      "palace. If this was only part of a settled policy, we may conjecture\n",
      "that similar transfers were effected in the population of other parts\n",
      "of the empire.\n",
      "\n",
      "The effect of such a policy would undoubtedly have been to weaken the\n",
      "power of resistance formerly possessed by self-contained city-states\n",
      "against the hegemony of any one of their number. In this respect the\n",
      "kings of Kish and Akkad would only have been carrying out, on a\n",
      "less ambitious scale and over a smaller area, the policy which the\n",
      "later Assyrian kings so ruthlessly enforced throughout the whole of\n",
      "Western Asia. But, although successful for a time, no state could be\n",
      "permanently established upon such a basis. The forces of discontent\n",
      "were bound to come to a head, and in Shar-Gani-sharri's own case we\n",
      "may perhaps trace to this cause the revolt of all the lands, which is\n",
      "recorded to have taken place in his old age. It is perhaps significant,\n",
      "too, that Urumush is related to have met his end in a palace\n",
      "revolution.[63]\n",
      "\n",
      "Tradition does not speak with any certain voice concerning the fate\n",
      "of Shar-Gani-sharri. Both the Omen-tablet and the Chronicle relate\n",
      "that he was besieged in the city of Akkad, and that he sallied forth\n",
      "and signally defeated his enemies. But the latter text ends its\n",
      "account of Sargon's reign with a record of disaster. \"Because of the\n",
      "evil which he had committed,\" the text runs, \"the great god Marduk\n",
      "was angry and he destroyed his people by famine. From the rising of\n",
      "the sun unto the setting of the sun they opposed him and gave him no\n",
      "rest.\" The expedition against Erech and Naksu, recorded in dates upon\n",
      "certain tablets inscribed during the patesiate of Lugal-ushumgal, may\n",
      "perhaps be referred to this period of unrest during the latter part\n",
      "of Sargon's reign.[64] The reference to Sargon's closing years on the\n",
      "Neo-Babylonian tablet is quite in the manner of the Hebrew books of\n",
      "Chronicles. The writer traces Sargon's misfortunes to his own evil\n",
      "deeds, in consequence of which the god Marduk sent troubles upon him\n",
      "as a punishment. It may seem strange that such an ending should follow\n",
      "the account of a brilliant and victorious reign. But it is perhaps\n",
      "permissible to see in the evil deeds ascribed to Sargon a reference to\n",
      "his policy of deportation, which may have raised him bitter enemies\n",
      "among the priesthood and the more conservative elements in the\n",
      "population of the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "There can be little doubt that Shar-Gani-sharri was succeeded on the\n",
      "throne of Akkad by NarÃ¢m-Sin, whom we may regard with considerable\n",
      "confidence as his son as well as his successor. In the later tradition\n",
      "NarÃ¢m-Sin is represented as the son of Sargon, and, although in his own\n",
      "inscriptions he never mentions his father's name, we have contemporary\n",
      "proof that his reign and that of Shar-Gani-sharri were very close\n",
      "to one another. The relation of Shar-Gani-sharri's pavement in the\n",
      "temple of Ekur to that of NarÃ¢m-Sin and the similar character of their\n",
      "building materials suggest that the structures were laid with no long\n",
      "interval between them, and the fact that Lugal-ushumgal, patesi of\n",
      "Lagash, was the contemporary of both Shar-Gani-sharri and NarÃ¢m-Sin[65]\n",
      "supports the presumption that the latter was Shar-Gani-sharri's\n",
      "successor on the throne. Hence such evidence as we possess is in favour\n",
      "of accepting the later tradition of their relationship to one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "NarÃ¢m-Sin's fame as a great conqueror, like that of his father,\n",
      "survived into later times, and the Omen-tablet and the Neo-Babylonian\n",
      "Chronicle relate his siege of the city of Apirak and the defeat of its\n",
      "governor and of RÃ®sh-Adad its king. Both texts also briefly record his\n",
      "successful expedition against the land of Magan. In the Omen-tablet the\n",
      "name of the king is wanting, but the lately recovered Chronicle has\n",
      "supplied it as Mannu-dannu. On this point the later tradition has been\n",
      "strikingly confirmed by the discovery at Susa of the base of a diorite\n",
      "statue of the king, on which it is recorded that he conquered Magan\n",
      "and slew Mani[...],[66] its prince or \"lord.\" The precise position of\n",
      "the land of Magan is still unsettled, some setting it in the Sinaitic\n",
      "peninsula, others regarding it as a portion of Eastern Arabia. In\n",
      "favour of the latter view it may be noted that from Southern Babylonia\n",
      "it would be easy of access by way of the Persian Gulf, and the\n",
      "transport of heavy blocks of diorite, which NarÃ¢m-Sin, and at a rather\n",
      "later period Gudea, brought from Magan, would be more easily effected\n",
      "by water than overland. In that case NarÃ¢m-Sin's invasion of Magan was\n",
      "in direct continuation of Shar-Gani-sharri's policy of extending his\n",
      "empire southwards to include the shores of the Persian Gulf.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the inscription upon this same statue, which NarÃ¢m-Sin records was\n",
      "fashioned from diorite brought to Akkad for that purpose from the\n",
      "mountains of Magan, he claims the proud title of \"king of the four\n",
      "quarters (of the world).\" Shar-Gani-sharri, in addition to his usual\n",
      "titles of \"the mighty one, the king of Akkad,\" describes himself in\n",
      "one of the texts upon his gate-sockets from Nippur as \"king of Enlil's\n",
      "realm,\" but in none of his inscriptions that have been recovered does\n",
      "he employ the title \"king of the four quarters.\" This may be merely a\n",
      "coincidence, and no inference should perhaps be drawn from the absence\n",
      "of the title from his texts. On the other hand, it is possible that its\n",
      "assumption by NarÃ¢m-Sin was based on a definite claim to a world-wide\n",
      "empire, the full extent of which his predecessor had not enjoyed.\n",
      "However this may be, we have ample evidence of NarÃ¢m-Sin's military\n",
      "activity. In the introductory lines on the statue already referred to\n",
      "he claims to have been the victor in nine separate battles, forced\n",
      "upon him by the attack of hostile forces, in the course of a single\n",
      "year. Conquests recorded in other inscriptions of NarÃ¢m-Sin are that of\n",
      "Armanu,[67] and of Satuni, king of Lulubu.[68] The latter region lay to\n",
      "the east of Akkad, in the mountainous region to the north-east of Elam,\n",
      "and its king appears to have formed a confederacy of the neighbouring\n",
      "districts to oppose the advance of Akkadian influence in that direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "The monument, which NarÃ¢m-Sin set up and dedicated in the temple of\n",
      "his god in commemoration of this latter victory, is one of the finest\n",
      "pieces of Babylonian sculpture that has yet been recovered.[69] It is\n",
      "a stele of victory, and the face is sculptured with a representation\n",
      "of the king conquering Satuni and his other enemies in a mountainous\n",
      "country. The king, whose figure is on a larger scale than the others,\n",
      "is nearly at the summit of a high mountain. He wears a helmet adorned\n",
      "with the horns of a bull, and he carries a battle-axe and a bow and\n",
      "arrow. Up the mountain side and along paths through the trees which\n",
      "clothe the lower slopes, the king's allies and warriors climb after\n",
      "him, bearing standards and weapons in their hands. Some of the king's\n",
      "foes are fleeing before him, and they turn in their flight to sue for\n",
      "mercy, while one still grasps a broken spear. Another has been shot by\n",
      "the king and crouches on the ground, seeking to draw the arrow from his\n",
      "throat. Two others lie prone before NarÃ¢m-Sin, who has planted his foot\n",
      "upon the breast of one of them. The peak of the mountain rises to the\n",
      "stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact that the stele was found at Susa has been employed as an\n",
      "argument in favour of regarding Elam as a dependency of Akkad during\n",
      "his reign. But, in addition to NarÃ¢m-Sin's own text, the stele bears a\n",
      "later inscription of the Elamite king Shutruk-Nakhkhunte, from which\n",
      "we may infer that it was captured in Northern Babylonia and carried\n",
      "off to Susa as a trophy of war. But it is not unlikely that NarÃ¢m-Sin,\n",
      "like Shar-Gani-sharri and the kings of Kish, achieved successes\n",
      "against Elam. Apirak, his conquest of which tradition records, was\n",
      "a country within the Elamite region, and its capture may well have\n",
      "taken place during a successful raid. Mention has been made of two\n",
      "early Elamite patesis, whose names have been recovered upon a tablet\n",
      "from Tello and an archaic text from Susa.[70] The patesi of Susa,\n",
      "whose name may be read as Ilishma, belongs to a period when that city\n",
      "acknowledged the suzerainty of Akkad. But this single name does not\n",
      "prove that Elam, however closely connected with Akkad by commercial\n",
      "ties, formed a regular province of the Akkadian empire. Ilishma may\n",
      "have been appointed to the throne of Susa by the king of Akkad during\n",
      "an invasion of that country, which reached its culmination in the\n",
      "deportation of the native king, as Shar-Gani-sharri deported the kings\n",
      "of KutÃ» and Amurru, and Manishtusu the king of Anshan. The available\n",
      "evidence suggests that, during the Dynasty of Akkad, Susa and Elam\n",
      "generally enjoyed their independence, subject to occasional periods of\n",
      "interruption.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within the limits of Sumer and Akkad NarÃ¢m-Sin appears to have followed\n",
      "his father's policy of materially benefiting the provincial cities,\n",
      "while keeping their administration under his immediate control. Thus he\n",
      "continued the service of convoys, and at the same time devoted himself\n",
      "to the erection of temples to the gods. His rebuilding of the temples\n",
      "of Enlil at Nippur and of Shamash at Sippar has been already referred\n",
      "to, while his votive onyx vases found at Tello[71] prove that he did\n",
      "not neglect the shrines of Lagash. Another Sumerian city in which he\n",
      "undertook building operations was Ninni-esh, for there he rebuilt the\n",
      "temple dedicated to the goddess Ninni in the same year that he laid the\n",
      "foundation of the temple at Nippur.[72]\n",
      "\n",
      "But by far the most interesting of his building records is the stele\n",
      "sculptured with the figure of himself,[73] which is usually known as\n",
      "the Diarbekr stele. When first brought to the Museum at Constantinople\n",
      "it was said to have been found at Mardin,[74] and later on, certainly\n",

      "We have seen that the Dynasty of Akkad marks the culminating point\n",
      "attained by the races of Sumer and Akkad during the earlier periods\n",
      "of their history. It is true that the kings of this period owed much\n",
      "to their immediate predecessors, but they added to and improved their\n",
      "inheritance. Through long centuries of slow development the village\n",
      "community had gradually been transformed into the city-state, and this\n",
      "institution had flourished and had in its turn decayed before the\n",
      "centralizing influence of the kingdoms of Sumer and Kish. It was on the\n",
      "ruins of the latter monarchy that Shar-Gani-sharri founded his empire,\n",
      "which differed from that of Kish in its extent, rather than in the\n",
      "principles of its formation. A similarly close connection can be traced\n",
      "between the cultural remains of the successive periods with which we\n",
      "have hitherto been dealing. The rude, though vigorous, artistic efforts\n",
      "of the earlier Sumerians furnished the models upon which the immigrant\n",
      "Semites of Northern Babylonia improved. In the sculpture of Kish and\n",
      "upon cylinder-seals of that period we see the transition between the\n",
      "two styles, when the aim at a naturalistic treatment sometimes produced\n",
      "awkward and grotesque results. The full attainment of this aim under\n",
      "the patronage of the Akkadian kings gives their epoch an interest and\n",
      "an importance, which, from their empire alone, it would not perhaps\n",
      "have enjoyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the earlier ages of Babylonian history afford a striking picture\n",
      "of gradual growth and development, the periods succeeding the Dynasty\n",
      "of Akkad are marked by a certain retrograde movement, or reversion to\n",
      "earlier ideals. The stimulus, which produced the empire and the art\n",
      "of Akkad, may be traced to the influx of fresh racial elements into\n",
      "Northern Babylonia and their fusion with the older and more highly\n",
      "cultured elements in the south. When the impulse was exhausted and\n",
      "the dynasties to which it had given rise had run their course, little\n",
      "further development along these lines took place. Both in art and\n",
      "politics a Sumerian reaction followed the period of Semitic power, and\n",
      "the establishment of the Dynasty of Ur was significant of more than\n",
      "a shifting of political influence southwards. It would appear that a\n",
      "systematic attempt was made to return to the earlier standards. But\n",
      "the influence of Akkad and her monarchs, though deliberately ignored\n",
      "and combated, was far from ineffective. As the sculptures of Gudea owe\n",
      "much to the period of NarÃ¢m-Sin, so the empire of Dungi was inevitably\n",
      "influenced by Shar-Gani-sharri's conquests. There was no sudden arrest\n",
      "either of the political or of the cultural development of the country.\n",
      "A recovery of power by the Sumerians merely changed the direction in\n",
      "which further development was to take place. Although, when viewed\n",
      "from a general standpoint, there is no break of continuity between the\n",
      "epoch of Akkad and that of Ur, there is some lack of information with\n",
      "regard to events in the intervening period. There is every indication\n",
      "that between the reign of NarÃ¢m-Sin and that of Ur-Engur, the founder\n",
      "of the Dynasty of Ur, we have to count in generations rather than in\n",
      "centuries, but the total length of the period is still unknown. The\n",
      "close of the Dynasty of Akkad, as we have already seen, is wrapped in\n",
      "mystery, but the gap in our knowledge may fortunately to some extent\n",
      "be bridged. At this point the city of Lagash once more comes to our\n",
      "assistance, and, by supplying the names of a number of her patesis,\n",
      "enables us to arrange a sequence of rulers, and thereby to form some\n",
      "estimate of the length of the period involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "It will be remembered that under Shar-Gani-sharri and NarÃ¢m-Sin a\n",
      "certain Lugal-ushumgal was patesi of Lagash, and that the impressions\n",
      "of his seals have been recovered which he employed during the reigns\n",
      "of these two monarchs.[1] The names of three other patesis of Lagash\n",
      "are known, who must also be assigned to the period of the Dynasty\n",
      "of Akkad, since they are mentioned upon tablets of that date. These\n",
      "are Ur-Babbar, Ur-E, and Lugal-bur; the first of these appears to\n",
      "have been the contemporary of NarÃ¢m-Sin,[2] and in that case he must\n",
      "have followed Lugal-ushumgal. As to Ur-E and Lugal-bur, we have\n",
      "no information beyond the fact that they lived during the period\n",
      "of the kings of Akkad. A further group of tablets found at Tello,\n",
      "differentiated in type from those of the Dynasty of Akkad on the one\n",
      "hand, and on the other from tablets of the Dynasty of Ur, furnishes\n",
      "us with the names of other patesis to be set in the period before the\n",
      "rise of Ur-Engur. Three of these, Basha-mama,[3] Ur-mama, and Ug-me,\n",
      "were probably anterior to Ur-Bau, who has left us ample proof of his\n",
      "building activity at Lagash. We possess a tablet dated in the accession\n",
      "year of Ur-mama, and another dated during the patesiate of Ug-me, in\n",
      "the year of the installation of the high priest in NinÃ¢.[4] A sealing\n",
      "of this last patesi's reign has also been found, which supports the\n",
      "attribution of this group of tablets to the period between the Sargonic\n",
      "era and that of Ur. The subject of the engraving upon the seal is the\n",
      "adoration of a deity, a scene of very common occurrence during the\n",
      "later period; but by its style and treatment the work vividly recalls\n",
      "that of the epoch of Shar-Gani-sharri and NarÃ¢m-Sin. On the strength of\n",
      "this evidence it has been argued that Ug-me's period was not far from\n",
      "that of Lugal-ushumgal, Ur-E, and Lugal-bur.[5]\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the documents of this period is dated during the patesiate of\n",
      "Ur-Bau himself, in the year in which he undertook certain extensive\n",
      "works of irrigation, while others are dated in the year of Ur-gar's\n",
      "accession, and in that which followed the accession of Nammakhni.[6]\n",
      "From other evidence we know that Nammakhni was Ur-Bau's son-in-law,\n",
      "since he espoused Ningandu, Ur-Bau's daughter, and secured through her\n",
      "his title to the throne.[7] Ur-gar, too, must belong to the generation\n",
      "following Ur-Bau, since a female statue has been found at Tello,\n",
      "which was dedicated to some deity by a daughter of Ur-Bau on behalf\n",
      "of her own life and that of Ur-gar, the patesi.[8] Tablets are also\n",
      "dated in the accession-years of Ka-azag, Galu-Bau, and Galu-Gula,[9]\n",
      "and their contents furnish indications that they date from about the\n",
      "same time.[10] Ur-Ninsun, whose name and title occur on the fragment\n",
      "of a bowl very similar to that employed by Nammakhni's wife,[11] is\n",
      "not mentioned on the tablets, but several are dated in the reigns of\n",
      "Gudea and of his son Ur-Ningirsu.[12] Now, in the reign of Dungi, the\n",
      "son of Ur-Engur, there lived a high priest of the goddess NinÃ¢ named\n",
      "Ur-Ningirsu; and, if we may identify this priestly official with the\n",
      "patesi of that name, as is very probable,[13] we obtain a definite\n",
      "point of contact between the later history of Lagash and that of Ur.\n",
      "But even if the synchronism between Ur-Ningirsu and Dungi be regarded\n",
      "as non-proven, there is no doubt that no long interval separated\n",
      "Gudea's reign from the Dynasty of Ur. The character of the art and the\n",
      "style of writing which we find in Lagash at this time are so similar to\n",
      "those of Ur, that the one period must have followed the other without\n",
      "a break. A striking example of the resemblance which existed in the\n",
      "artistic productions of the two cities at this time is afforded by the\n",
      "votive copper cones, or nails, of Gudea and Dungi, surmounted by the\n",
      "figures of a bull _couchant_. A glance will show the slight changes in\n",
      "the form and treatment of the subject which have been introduced by the\n",
      "metal-workers of Dungi's reign.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: Fig. 62.--Fig. 63. Copper figures of bulls surmounting\n",

      "\n",
      "From the brief summary given in the preceding paragraphs it will have\n",
      "been noted that we have recovered the names of some twelve patesis of\n",
      "Lagash, who may be assigned to the period between the dynasties of\n",
      "Akkad and Ur. Of these twelve names no less than eleven occur upon a\n",
      "group of tablets, which were found together at Tello, and are marked\n",
      "out by their shape and contents as belonging to a single period. The\n",
      "tablets themselves are of unbaked clay, and they form a transition\n",
      "between the types of Akkad and Ur. In the last of the reigns mentioned\n",
      "it is probable that we may trace a synchronism with the Dynasty of\n",
      "Ur, and, although no actual point of contact can yet be established\n",
      "with the Dynasty of Akkad, such evidence as that furnished by Ug-me's\n",
      "sealing suggests that no considerable lapse of time can have taken\n",
      "place. That these twelve patesis were the only ones who ruled at Lagash\n",
      "during this interval is improbable, and at any time the names of other\n",
      "rulers may be recovered. But it is certain the reigns of many of these\n",
      "patesis were extremely brief, and that we have not to do with a single\n",
      "dynasty, firmly established throughout the whole period, whose separate\n",
      "members, after their accession, each held the throne for the term of\n",
      "his natural life. We have definite proof that several of the patesis,\n",
      "such as Ka-azag, Galu-Bau, and Galu-Gula, ruled only for a few years,\n",
      "and it would seem that at certain points during this period a change of\n",
      "rulers took place in Lagash with considerable frequency.\n",
      "\n",
      "The employment of the title of patesi, and the total absence of that\n",
      "of \"king\" at this time, suggests that Lagash had not succeeded in\n",
      "establishing her independence, and still owed allegiance to some alien\n",
      "dynasty. It is in accordance with this view that the dates inscribed\n",
      "upon the commercial tablets do not refer to events of a military\n",
      "character. We may conclude that, at any rate until the reign of Gudea,\n",
      "Lagash and her rulers were not concerned to enforce their authority\n",
      "over other cities, nor to defend their own border from attack. The\n",
      "existence of a more powerful city, claiming the hegemony in Babylonia,\n",
      "would account for the absence of military enterprise reflected in\n",
      "the date-formulÃ¦ and in the foundation-records of the time. For such\n",
      "a city, while guaranteeing the integrity of each of her tributary\n",
      "states, would have resented the inauguration of an ambitious policy by\n",
      "any one of them. On the other hand, the purely local character of the\n",
      "events commemorated in the date-formulÃ¦ is no less significant. These\n",
      "are without exception drawn from the local history of Lagash, and\n",
      "betray no evidence of the authority exercised by a foreign suzerain.\n",
      "It is therefore probable that during the greater part of this period\n",
      "Lagash enjoyed a considerable measure of autonomy, and that such bonds\n",
      "as may have united her to any central administration were far less\n",
      "tightly drawn than at the time of Shar-Gani-sharri and NarÃ¢m-Sin.\n",
      "Like Lagash, her old rival Umma seems to have survived as a patesiate\n",
      "under the later Semitic rulers in the north, and it is probably to\n",
      "this time that we may assign Galu-Babbar, the patesi of that city,\n",
      "three of whose votive cones are preserved in the British Museum.[14]\n",
      "During the earlier part of this period Lagash presents the picture of\n",
      "a compact and peaceful state, content to develop her own resources. A\n",
      "considerable increase of power is noticeable in the reign of Gudea, the\n",
      "most famous ruler of the period, who, though still retaining the title\n",
      "of patesi, must be regarded as practically an independent sovereign,\n",
      "since he was strong enough to undertake a successful campaign in Elam,\n",
      "and imported his building materials from Arabia and the Syrian coast.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the exception of Gudea, the only ruler of this period who has\n",
      "left us any considerable records or remains is Ur-Bau, the predecessor\n",
      "of Nammakhni and Ur-gar upon the throne of Lagash. We possess a small\n",
      "diorite statue of this ruler, which, like most of those found at Tello,\n",
      "is without its head.[15] It is a standing figure, and its squat and\n",
      "conventional proportions suffice to show that it must date from a\n",
      "rather earlier period than the larger and finer statues of Gudea, which\n",
      "are fashioned from the same hard material. Gudea definitely states that\n",
      "he fetched the diorite for his series of large statues from Magan, but\n",
      "Ur-Bau makes no such boast; and, although it is clear that his stone\n",
      "must have come from the same quarries, we may probably conclude that\n",
      "the small block he employed for his figure had not been procured as the\n",
      "result of a special expedition. In fact, such records as he has left us\n",
      "portray him as devoting all his energies to the building of temples\n",

      "the form of a picturesque narrative, adorned with striking similes and\n",
      "a wealth of detailed description such as are not found in the texts of\n",

      "name his father, and it is possible that he was a man of obscure or\n",
      "doubtful birth. The energy which he displayed as patesi is sufficient\n",
      "to account for his rise to power, and the success which attended his\n",
      "period of rule may be held to have amply justified a break in the\n",
      "succession. Another problem suggested by a study of his texts concerns\n",
      "the source of the wealth which enabled him to undertake the rebuilding\n",
      "and refurnishing of the temples of Lagash upon so elaborate a scale.\n",
      "The cause of such activity we should naturally seek in the booty\n",
      "obtained during a number of successful campaigns, but throughout the\n",
      "whole of his inscriptions we have only a single reference to an act\n",
      "of war. On the statue of himself in the character of an architect,\n",
      "holding the plan of E-ninnÃ» upon his knees, he gives in some detail an\n",

      "mention of a victory that occurs in Gudea's inscriptions, and, although\n",
      "in itself it proves that he was sufficiently independent to carry on a\n",

      "sixty cubits in length, and he also brought down from the mountain\n",
      "logs of urkarinnu-wood five-and-twenty cubits long. From the town of\n",

      "ashukhu-wood and plane-trees. From Umanu, a mountain of Menua, and\n",
      "from Basalla, a mountain of Amurru, he obtained great blocks of stone\n",
      "and made stelÃ¦ from them, which he set up in the court of E-ninnÃ».\n",
      "From Tidanu, another mountain of Amurru, he brought pieces of marble,\n",
      "and from Kagalad, a mountain of Kimash, he extracted copper, which he\n",
      "tells us he used in making a great mace-head. From the mountains of\n",
      "Melukhkha he brought ushÃ»-wood, which he employed in the construction\n",
      "of the temple, and he fetched gold-dust from the mountain of Khakhu and\n",
      "with it he gilded a mace-head carved with the heads of three lions. In\n",
      "Gubin, the mountain of khuluppu-wood, he felled khuluppu-trees; from\n",
      "Madga he obtained asphalt, which he used in making the platform of\n",
      "E-ninnÃ»; and from the mountain of Barshib he brought down blocks of\n",

      "The above list of places makes it clear that Gudea obtained his wood\n",
      "and stone from mountains on the coast of Syria and in Arabia, and\n",
      "his copper from mines in Elam. On the first of his cylinders he also\n",
      "states that the Elamite came from Elam and the man of Susa from Susa,\n",
      "presumably to take part as skilled craftsmen in the construction of the\n",
      "temple. In this account he does not mention the names of so many places\n",
      "as in the statue-inscription, but he adds some picturesque details with\n",
      "regard to the difficulties of transport he encountered. Thus he records\n",
      "that into the mountain of cedars, where no man before had penetrated,\n",
      "he cut a road for bringing down the cedars and beams of other precious\n",
      "woods. He also made roads into the mountains where he quarried stone,\n",
      "and, in addition to gold and copper, he states that he obtained silver\n",
      "also in the mountains. The stone he transported by water, and he adds\n",
      "that the ships bringing bitumen and plaster from Madga were loaded as\n",
      "though they were barges carrying grain.\n",

      "Gubi, and Dilmun collected wood, and that ships loaded with wood of\n",
      "all kinds came to the port of Lagash. Moreover, on eight out of his\n",
      "eleven statues he records that the diorite, from which he fashioned\n",
      "them, was brought from Magan. In his search for building materials, he\n",
      "asserts that he journeyed from the lower country to the upper country;\n",
      "and, when summarizing the area over which he and his agents ranged, he\n",
      "adopts an ancient formula, and states that Ningirsu, his beloved king,\n",

      "Gudea's reign may be regarded as marking a revival of Sumerian\n",
      "prosperity, consequent on the decay of Semitic influence and power\n",
      "in the north. The fact that he was able to import his wood and stone\n",

      "considerable weakening of the northern cities. Whether Akkad, or some\n",

      "districts it is impossible to say, but it is at least clear that in\n",
      "the reign of Gudea no such claim was either recognized or enforced.\n",
      "We may suppose that Lagash and the other great cities in the south,\n",
      "relieved from the burden of Semitic domination, enjoyed a period of\n",
      "peace and tranquillity, which each city employed for the development of\n",
      "her material resources. The city of Ur was soon to bring this state of\n",
      "affairs to a close, by claiming the hegemony among the southern cities\n",
      "and founding the kingdom of Sumer and Akkad by force of arms. But\n",
      "during Gudea's reign Ur appears to have made no movement, and Lagash\n",

      "It is possible that we may trace the unparalleled building activity,\n",
      "which characterized Gudea's reign, in part to a development in\n",
      "the art of building, which appears to have taken place at about\n",
      "this period. It has been suggested that both Gudea and Ur-Engur,\n",
      "the founder of the Dynasty of Ur, participated in the same great\n",
      "architectural movement,[21] and proof of this has been seen in their\n",
      "common employment of the smaller square brick, measuring from about\n",
      "twelve to thirteen inches, which was more easy to handle than the\n",
      "larger bricks employed by Ur-Bau and at the time of the Dynasty of\n",
      "Akkad. The inherent advantages of this form of brick are attested by\n",
      "its retention, with but slight variations, down to the end of the\n",
      "Babylonian empire. That Gudea himself set considerable store by the\n",
      "form of the bricks which he employed would seem to follow from the\n",
      "passage in his first cylinder-inscription, where he describes the\n",
      "ceremonies with which he inaugurated their manufacture, including the\n",
      "offer of sacrifices and the pouring of a libation into the sacred\n",
      "mould.[22] The use of an improved material may well have incited him\n",
      "to rebuild the greater number of the sanctuaries in Lagash on their\n",
      "ancient sites, but enlarged and beautified in accordance with the\n",
      "new architectural ideas. From another passage in his texts it would\n",
      "seem that he definitely claimed to have inaugurated a novel form of\n",
      "building, or decoration, such as no patesi before him had employed.[23]\n",
      "The meaning of the phrase is not quite certain, but it may, perhaps,\n",
      "have reference to the sculptured reliefs with which he adorned E-ninnÃ».\n",
      "It may also refer to the use of raised pilasters for the adornment of\n",
      "facades and external walls, a form that is characteristic of later\n",
      "Babylonian architecture, but is not found in the remains of buildings\n",

      "\n",
      "In addition to E-ninnÃ», the great temple of the city-god Ningirsu,\n",
      "Gudea records that he rebuilt the shrines dedicated to Bau and\n",
      "Ninkharsag, and E-anna, the temple of the goddess Ninni, and he erected\n",
      "temples to Galalim and Dunshagga, two of Ningirsu's sons. In Uru-azagga\n",
      "he rebuilt Gatumdug's temple, and in Girsu three temples to Nindub,\n",

      "too, he built a temple to Ningishzida, his patron god, whom he appears\n",
      "to have introduced at this time into the pantheon of Lagash. One of the\n",
      "most novel of his reconstructions was the E-pa, the temple of the seven\n",

      "the form of a tower in seven stages, a true ziggurat, which may be\n",
      "compared with those of Ur-Engur. But the work on which he most prided\n",
      "himself was the rebuilding of E-ninnÃ», and to this he devoted all the\n",

      "one is the statue of the architect with the plan, and another, a seated\n",
      "figure, is the only one of the series of colossal proportions. Three\n",

      "the only one of which we possess the head, for this was discovered\n",
      "by Commandant Cros during the more recent diggings at Tello, and was\n",
      "fitted by M. Heuzey to the body of the figure which had been preserved\n",
      "in the Louvre for many years.[27] From the photographic reproduction\n",
      "it will be seen that the size of the head is considerably out of\n",
      "proportion to that of the body; and it must be admitted that even the\n",
      "larger statues are not all of equal merit. While in some of them the\n",

      "true sense of proportion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some interesting variations of treatment may also be noted in two of\n",
      "the standing statues from the temple of Bau. One of these is narrow\n",
      "in the shoulders and slender of form, and is in striking contrast to\n",
      "the other, which presents the figure of a strong and broad-shouldered\n",
      "man. It would seem that the statues were sculptured at different\n",
      "periods of Gudea's life, and from the changes observable we may infer\n",
      "that he ascended the throne while still a young man and that his\n",
      "reign must have been a long one. The diorite which he used for them\n",
      "was very highly prized for its durability and beauty, and the large\n",
      "block that was required for his colossal figure appears, when the\n",
      "carving was completed, to have been regarded as far more precious than\n",
      "lapis-lazuli, silver, and other metals.[28] Certainly the preparation\n",
      "of so hard a stone presented more difficulty than that of any other\n",
      "material, and that Gudea's sculptors should have learnt to deal\n",
      "successfully with such large masses of it argues a considerable advance\n",
      "in the development of their art.\n",
      "\n",
      "The small copper figures of a kneeling god grasping a cone are also\n",
      "characteristic of Gudea's period, but in design and workmanship they\n",
      "are surpassed by the similar votive figure which dates from Ur-Bau's\n",
      "reign.[29] A fine example of carving in relief is furnished by the oval\n",
      "panel, in which Gudea is represented as being led into the presence of\n",
      "his god;[30] a similar scene of worship, though on a smaller scale, is\n",
      "engraved upon his cylinder-seal.[31] A happy example of carving in the\n",
      "round, as exhibited by smaller objects of this period, is his small\n",
      "mace-head of breccia decorated with the heads of three lions. In design\n",
      "this clearly resembles the mace-head referred to on one of the statues\n",
      "from E-ninnÃ», though, unlike it, the small mace-head was probably not\n",
      "gilded, since the inscription upon it mentions the mountain in Syria\n",
      "whence the breccia was obtained. But other carved objects of stone\n",
      "that have been recovered may well have been enriched in that way, and\n",
      "to their underlying material they probably owe their preservation. The\n",
      "precious metal may have been stripped from these and the stone cores\n",
      "thrown aside; but similar work in solid gold or silver would scarcely\n",
      "have escaped the plunderer's hands.\n",

      "Gudea decided to rebuild Ningirsu's temple, it is probable that during\n",
      "the greater part of his reign the state of Lagash enjoyed unparalleled\n",
      "abundance, such as is said to have followed the completion of that\n",
      "work. The date-formula for one of his years of rule takes its title\n",
      "from the cutting of a new canal which he named Ningirsu-ushumgal, and\n",
      "there is no doubt that he kept the elaborate system of irrigation,\n",
      "by which Lagash and her territories were supplied with water, in a\n",
      "perfect state of repair. Evidence of the plentiful supplies which\n",
      "the temple-lands produced may be seen in the increase of the regular\n",
      "offerings decreed by Gudea. On New Year's day, for instance, at\n",
      "the feast of Bau, after he had rebuilt her temple, he added to the\n",
      "marriage-gifts which were her due, consisting of oxen, sheep, lambs,\n",
      "baskets of dates, pots of butter, figs, cakes, birds, fish, and\n",
      "precious woods, etc. He also records special offerings of clothing and\n",
      "wool which he made to her, and of sacrificial beasts to Ningirsu and\n",
      "the goddess NinÃ¢. For the new temple of Gatumdug he mentions the gift\n",
      "of herds of cattle and flocks of sheep, together with their herdsmen\n",
      "and shepherds, and of irrigation-oxen and their keepers for the sacred\n",
      "lands of E-ninnÃ». Such references point to an increase in the revenues\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The more recent finds at Tello have enabled us to bridge the gap\n",
      "which formerly existed in our knowledge of Chaldean history and\n",
      "civilization between the age of NarÃ¢m-Sin and the rise of the city\n",
      "of Ur under Ur-Engur, the founder of the kingdom of Sumer and Akkad.\n",
      "What we now know of Lagash during this period may probably be regarded\n",
      "as typical of the condition of the other great Sumerian cities. The\n",
      "system of government, by means of which Shar-Gani-sharri and NarÃ¢m-Sin\n",
      "had exercised control over Sumer from their capital in the north,\n",
      "had doubtless been maintained for a time by their successors; but,\n",
      "from the absence of any trace of their influence at Tello, we cannot\n",
      "regard their organization as having been equally effective. They, or\n",
      "the Semitic kings of some other northern city, may have continued\n",
      "to exercise a general suzerainty over the whole of Babylonia, but\n",
      "the records of Lagash seem to show that the larger and more distant\n",
      "cities were left in the enjoyment of practical independence. The\n",
      "mere existence of a suzerain, however, who had inherited the throne\n",
      "or empire of Shar-Gani-sharri and NarÃ¢m-Sin, must have acted as a\n",
      "deterrent influence upon any ambitious prince or patesi, and would thus\n",
      "have tended to maintain a condition of equilibrium between the separate\n",
      "states of which that empire had been composed. We have seen that Lagash\n",
      "took advantage of this time of comparative inactivity to develop her\n",
      "resources along peaceful lines. She gladly returned to the condition\n",
      "of a compact city-state, without dropping the intercourse with distant\n",
      "countries which had been established under the earlier Akkadian kings.\n",
      "\n",
      "During this period we may suppose that the city of Ur enjoyed a similar\n",
      "measure of independence, which increased in proportion to the decline\n",
      "of Semitic authority in the north. Gudea's campaign against Anshan\n",
      "affords some indication of the capability of independent action, to\n",
      "which the southern cities gradually attained. It is not likely that\n",
      "such initiative on the part of Lagash was unaccompanied by a like\n",
      "activity within the neighbouring, and more powerful, state of Ur.\n",
      "In an earlier age the twin kingdoms of Ur and Erech had dominated\n",
      "southern Babylonia, and their rulers had established the kingdom of\n",
      "Sumer, which took an active part in opposing the advance of Semitic\n",
      "influence southwards. The subjection of Sumer by the Dynasty of Akkad\n",
      "put an end for a time to all thoughts of independence on the part of\n",
      "separate cities, although the expedition against Erech and Naksu, which\n",
      "occurred in the patesiate of Lugal-ushumgal, supports the tradition\n",
      "of a revolt of all the lands in the latter part of Sargon's reign. Ur\n",
      "would doubtless have been ready to lend assistance to such a movement,\n",
      "and we may imagine that she was not slow to take advantage of the\n",
      "gradual weakening of Akkad under her later rulers. At a time when\n",
      "Gudea was marching across the Elamite border, or sending unchecked for\n",
      "his supplies to the Mediterranean coast or the islands of the Persian\n",
      "Gulf, Ur was doubtless organizing her own forces, and may possibly have\n",
      "already made tentative efforts at forming a coalition of neighbouring\n",
      "states. She only needed an energetic leader, and this she found in\n",
      "Ur-Engur, who succeeded in uniting the scattered energies of Sumer and\n",
      "so paved the way for the more important victories of his son.\n",
      "\n",
      "That Ur-Engur was the founder of his dynasty we know definitely from\n",
      "the dynastic chronicle, which was recovered during the American\n",
      "excavations at Nippur.[1] In this document he is given as the first\n",
      "king of the Dynasty of Ur, the text merely stating that he became king\n",
      "and ruled for eighteen years. Unfortunately the preceding columns of\n",
      "the text are wanting, and we do not know what dynasty was set down\n",
      "in the list as preceding that of Ur, nor is any indication afforded\n",
      "of the circumstances which led to Ur-Engur's accession. From his\n",
      "building-inscriptions that have been recovered on different sites in\n",
      "Southern Babylonia[2] it is possible, however, to gather some idea\n",
      "of his achievements and the extent of his authority. After securing\n",
      "the throne he appears to have directed his attention to putting the\n",
      "affairs of Ur in order. In two of his brick-inscriptions from Mukayyar,\n",
      "Ur-Engur bears the single title \"king of Ur,\" and these may therefore\n",
      "be assigned to the beginning of his reign, when his kingdom did not\n",
      "extend beyond the limits of his native city. These texts record the\n",
      "rebuilding of the temple of Nannar, the Moon-god, and the repair and\n",
      "extension of the city-wall of Ur.[3] His work on the temple of the\n",
      "city-god no doubt won for him the support of the priesthood, and so\n",
      "strengthened his hold upon the throne; while, by rebuilding and adding\n",
      "to the fortifications of Ur, he secured his city against attack before\n",
      "he embarked upon a policy of expansion.\n",
      "\n",
      "We may assume with some confidence that the first city over which\n",
      "he extended his authority was Erech. It would necessarily have been\n",
      "his first objective, for by its position it would have blocked\n",
      "any northward advance. The importance attached by Ur-Engur to the\n",
      "occupation of this city is reflected in the title \"Lord of Erech,\"\n",
      "which precedes his usual titles upon bricks from the temple of the\n",
      "Moon-god at Ur, dating from a later period of his reign; his assumption\n",
      "of the title indicates that Erech was closely associated with Ur,\n",
      "though not on a footing of equality. That he should have rebuilt\n",
      "E-anna, the great temple of Ninni in Erech, as we learn from bricks\n",
      "found at Warka, was a natural consequence of its acquisition, for by\n",
      "so doing he exercised his privilege as suzerain. But he honoured the\n",
      "city above others which he acquired, by installing his own son there as\n",
      "high priest of the goddess Ninni, an event which gave its official\n",
      "title to one of the years of his reign. We have definite evidence that\n",
      "he also held the neighbouring city of Larsa, for bricks have been found\n",
      "at Senkera, which record his rebuilding of the temple of Babbar, the\n",
      "Sun-god. With the acquisition of Lagash, he was doubtless strong enough\n",
      "to obtain the recognition of his authority throughout the whole of\n",
      "Sumer.\n",

      "The only other city, in which direct evidence has been found of\n",
      "Ur-Engur's building activity, is Nippur. From the American excavations\n",
      "on that site we learn that he rebuilt E-kur, Enlil's great temple,\n",
      "and also that of Ninlil, his spouse. It was doubtless on the strength\n",
      "of his holding Nippur that he assumed the title of King of Sumer and\n",
      "Akkad. How far his authority was recognized in Akkad it is impossible\n",
      "to say, but the necessity for the conquest of Babylon in Dungi's\n",
      "reign would seem to imply that Ur-Engur's suzerainty over at least a\n",
      "part of the country was more or less nominal. Khashkhamer, patesi of\n",
      "Ishkun-Sin, whose seal is now preserved in the British Museum,[4] was\n",
      "his subject, and the Semitic character of the name of his city suggests\n",
      "that it lay in Northern Babylonia. Moreover, certain tablets drawn up\n",
      "in his reign are dated in \"the year in which King Ur-Engur took his\n",
      "way from the lower to the upper country,\" a phrase that may possibly\n",
      "imply a military expedition in the north. Thus some portions of Akkad\n",
      "may have been effectively held by Ur-Engur, but it is certain that the\n",
      "complete subjugation of the country was only effected during Dungi's\n",
      "reign.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Sumer, on the other hand, Ur-Engur's sway was unquestioned. His\n",
      "appointment of Ur-abba as patesi of Lagash was probably characteristic\n",
      "of his treatment of the southern cities: by the substitution of his own\n",
      "adherents in place of the reigning patesis, he would have secured loyal\n",
      "support in the administration of his dependent states. We have evidence\n",
      "of one of his administrative acts, so far as Lagash is concerned. On\n",
      "a clay cone from Tello he records that, after he had built the temple\n",
      "of Enlil, he dug a canal in honour of the Moon-god, Nannar, which he\n",
      "named Nannar-gugal. He describes the canal as a boundary-ditch, and\n",
      "we may conjecture that it marked a revision of the frontier between\n",
      "the territories of two cities, possibly that between Lagash and lands\n",
      "belonging to the city of Ur. In the same inscription he tells us that,\n",
      "in accordance with the laws of the Sun-god, he caused justice to\n",
      "prevail, a claim that affords some indication of the spirit in which he\n",
      "governed the cities he had incorporated in his kingdom.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the reign of Dungi, who succeeded his father upon the throne and\n",
      "inherited from him the kingdom of Sumer and Akkad, the whole of\n",
      "Northern Babylonia was brought to acknowledge the suzerainty of Ur.\n",
      "Considerable light has been thrown upon Dungi's policy, and indirectly\n",
      "upon that of the whole of Ur-Engur's dynasty, by the recently published\n",
      "chronicle concerning early Babylonian kings, to which reference has\n",
      "already been made. The earlier sections of this document, dealing with\n",
      "the reigns of Sargon and NarÃ¢m-Sin, are followed by a short account\n",
      "of Dungi's reign, from which we learn two facts of considerable\n",
      "significance.[5] The first of these is that Dungi \"cared greatly for\n",
      "the city of Eridu, which was on the shore of the sea,\" and the second\n",
      "is that \"he sought after evil, and the treasure of E-sagila and of\n",
      "Babylon he brought out as spoil.\" It will be noted that the writer of\n",
      "the chronicle, who was probably a priest in the temple of E-sagila,\n",
      "disapproved of his treatment of Babylon, in consequence of which he\n",
      "states that BÃªl (_i.e._ Marduk) made an end of him. In view of the fact\n",
      "that Dungi reigned for no less than fifty-eight years and consolidated\n",
      "an extensive empire, it is not improbable that the evil fate ascribed\n",
      "to him in the chronicle was suggested by Babylonian prejudice. But the\n",
      "Babylonian colouring of the narrative does not affect the historical\n",
      "value of the other traditions, but rather enhances them. For it is\n",
      "obvious that the disaster to the city and to E-sagila was not an\n",
      "invention, and must, on the contrary, have been of some magnitude for\n",
      "its record to have been preserved in Babylon itself through later\n",
      "generations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Dungi's treatment of Babylon, and in his profanation of the temple\n",
      "of its city-god, we have striking proof that the rise of the Dynasty of\n",
      "Ur was accompanied by a religious as well as a political revolution.\n",
      "Late tradition retained the memory of Sargon's building activity in\n",
      "Babylon, and under his successors upon the throne of Akkad the great\n",
      "temple of E-sagila may well have become the most important shrine in\n",
      "Northern Babylonia and the centre of Semitic worship. Eridu, on the\n",
      "other hand, was situated in the extreme south of Sumer and contained\n",
      "the oldest and most venerated temple of the Sumerians. Dungi's care for\n",
      "the latter city to the detriment of Babylon, emphasized by contrast in\n",
      "the late records of his reign, suggests that he aimed at a complete\n",
      "reversal of the conditions which had prevailed during the preceding\n",
      "age. The time was ripe for a Sumerian reaction, and Ur-Engur's initial\n",
      "success in welding the southern cities into a confederation of states\n",
      "under his own suzerainty may be traced to the beginning of this racial\n",
      "movement. Dungi continued and extended his father's policy, and his\n",
      "sack of Babylon may probably be regarded as the decisive blow in the\n",
      "struggle, which had been taking place against the last centres of\n",
      "Semitic influence in the north.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other evidence is not lacking of the Sumerian national revival, which\n",
      "characterized the period of the kings of Sumer and Akkad. Of Ur-Engur's\n",
      "inscriptions every one is written in Sumerian, in striking contrast to\n",
      "the texts which date from the time of Shar-Gani-sharri and NarÃ¢m-Sin.\n",
      "Of the still more numerous records of Dungi's reign, only two short\n",
      "votive formulÃ¦ are written in Semitic Babylonian, and one of these\n",
      "is from the northern city of Cutha. The predominant use of Sumerian\n",
      "also characterizes the texts of the remaining members of Ur-Engur's\n",
      "dynasty and the few inscriptions of the Dynasty of Isin that have\n",
      "been recovered.[6] In fact, only one of these is in Semitic, a short\n",
      "brick-inscription giving the name and titles of Gimil-Sin, which was\n",
      "found at Susa. It is true that the last three kings of the Dynasty of\n",
      "Ur apparently bear Semitic names, and of the rulers of the Dynasty\n",
      "of Isin the Semitic character of the majority of the names is not\n",
      "in doubt. But this in itself does not prove that their bearers were\n",
      "Semites, and a study of the proper names occurring in the numerous\n",
      "commercial documents and tablets of accounts, which were drawn up under\n",
      "the kings of Ur and Isin, are invariably Sumerian in character.[7] A\n",
      "more convincing test than that of the royal names is afforded by the\n",
      "cylinder-seals of the period. In these both subject and treatment are\n",
      "Sumerian, resembling the seals of Lagash at the time of Gudea and\n",
      "having little in common with those of the Dynasty of Akkad. Moreover,\n",
      "the worshippers engraved upon the seals are Sumerians, not Semites.\n",
      "Two striking examples are the seal of Khashkhamer, the contemporary\n",
      "and dependant of Ur-Engur, and that which Kilulla-guzala,[8] the son\n",
      "of Ur-baga, dedicated to Meslamtaea for the preservation of Dungi's\n",
      "life.[9] It will be noticed that on each of these seals the worshipper\n",
      "has a shaven head and wears the fringed Sumerian tunic. There can\n",
      "be little doubt, therefore, that Ur-Engur and his descendants were\n",
      "Sumerians, and we may probably regard the Dynasty of Isin as a\n",
      "continuation of the same racial movement which led to the establishment\n",
      "of the kingdom of Sumer and Akkad.[10]\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides affording information with regard to the racial characteristics\n",
      "of the inhabitants of Southern Babylonia, the official lists and\n",
      "commercial documents of this period indirectly throw light upon\n",
      "historical events. In the first great collection of tablets found by M.\n",
      "de Sarzec at Tello, the majority of those belonging to Dungi's period\n",
      "were dated in the later years of his reign; but among the tablets\n",
      "recovered during the more recent diggings on the site are many dated in\n",
      "his earlier years. The date-formulÃ¦ inscribed upon these documents, in\n",
      "conjunction with fragmentary date-lists, have rendered it possible to\n",
      "arrange the titles of the years in order for the greater part of his\n",
      "reign; and, since the years were named after important occurrences,\n",
      "such as the building or inauguration of temples in different cities and\n",
      "the successful prosecution of foreign campaigns, they form a valuable\n",
      "source of information concerning the history of the period.[11] From\n",
      "these we can gather some idea of the steps by which Dungi increased\n",
      "his empire, and of the periods in his reign during which he achieved\n",
      "his principal conquests. During his earlier years it would seem that\n",
      "he was occupied in securing complete control within the districts of\n",
      "Northern Babylonia, which he had nominally inherited from his father.\n",
      "The sack of Babylon may well have been commemorated in the title for\n",
      "the year in which it took place, and, if so, it must be placed within\n",
      "the first decade of his reign, where a gap occurs in our sequence of\n",
      "the date-formulÃ¦. Such of the earlier titles as have been recovered\n",
      "refer for the most part to the building of palaces and temples, the\n",
      "installation of deities within their shrines, and the like. It is not\n",
      "until the thirty-fourth year of his reign that a foreign conquest is\n",
      "explicitly recorded.\n",
      "\n",
      "But before this period there are indications that an expansion of\n",
      "Dungi's empire was already taking place. In the nineteenth year of his\n",
      "reign he installed the goddess Kadi in her temple at Der, an act which\n",
      "proves that the principal frontier town on the Elamite border was at\n",
      "this time in his possession. In the following year he installed in his\n",

      "that he had imposed his suzerainty over this country, the conquest of\n",
      "which, according to the late tradition, had been a notable achievement\n",
      "of Sargon's reign. In his twenty-sixth year he appointed his daughter\n",
      "to be \"lady\" of the Elamite region of Markharshi, a record that throws\n",
      "an interesting light upon the position enjoyed by women among the\n",
      "Sumerians. These districts, and others of which we have no knowledge,\n",
      "may well have been won by conquest, for it is obvious that the official\n",
      "date-formulÃ¦ could not take account of every military expedition,\n",
      "especially in years when an important religious event had also taken\n",
      "place. But, in the case of the three countries referred to, it is also\n",
      "possible that little opposition was offered to their annexation, and\n",
      "for that reason the title of the year may have merely recorded Dungi's\n",
      "performance of his chief privilege as suzerain, or the appointment of\n",
      "his representative as ruler. Whichever explanation be adopted, it is\n",
      "clear that Dungi was already gaining possession of regions which had\n",
      "formed part of the empire of the Semitic kings of Akkad.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to acquiring their territory, Dungi also seems to have\n",
      "borrowed from the Semites one of their most effective weapons, for\n",
      "the twenty-eighth year of his reign was known as that in which he\n",
      "enrolled the sons of Ur as archers. The principal weapon of the earlier\n",
      "Sumerians was the spear, and they delivered their attack in close\n",
      "formation, the spearmen being protected in line of battle by heavy\n",
      "shields carried by shield-bearers. For other purposes of offence they\n",
      "depended chiefly on the battle-axe and possibly the dart, but these\n",
      "were subsidiary weapons, fitted rather for the pursuit of a flying\n",
      "enemy when once their main attack had been delivered. Eannatum's\n",
      "victories testify to the success achieved by the method of attack in\n",
      "heavy phalanx against an enemy with inferior arms. The bow appears\n",
      "to have been introduced by the Semites, and they may have owed their\n",
      "success in battle largely to its employment: it would have enabled\n",
      "them to break up and demoralize the serried ranks of the Sumerians,\n",
      "before they could get to close quarters. Dungi doubtless recognized\n",
      "the advantage the weapon would give his own forces, especially when\n",
      "fighting in a hilly country, where the heavy spear and shield would\n",
      "be of little service, and it would be difficult to retain a close\n",
      "formation. We may conjecture that he found his companies of bowmen of\n",
      "considerable assistance in the series of successful campaigns, which\n",
      "he carried out in Elam and the neighbouring regions, during the latter\n",
      "half of his reign.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of these campaigns we know that the first conquest of Gankhar took\n",
      "place in Dungi's thirty-fourth year, and that of Simuru in the year\n",
      "that followed. The latter district does not appear to have submitted\n",
      "tamely to annexation, for in his thirty-sixth year Dungi found it\n",
      "necessary to send a fresh expedition for its reconquest. In the\n",
      "following year he followed up these successes by the conquest of\n",
      "Kharshi and Khumurti. Gankhar and Simuru were probably situated in\n",
      "the mountainous districts to the east of the Tigris, around the upper\n",
      "course of the Diyala, in the neighbourhood of Lulubu; for the four\n",
      "countries Urbillu, Simuru, Lulubu, and Gankhar formed the object of\n",
      "a single expedition undertaken by Dungi in his fifty-fifth year.[12]\n",
      "Kharshi, or Kharishi, appears to have also lain in the region to the\n",
      "east of the Tigris.[13] These victories doubtless led to the submission\n",
      "of other districts, for in his fortieth year Dungi married one of his\n",
      "daughters to the patesi of Anshan, among the most important of Elamite\n",
      "states. The warlike character of the Elamites is attested by the\n",
      "difficulty Dungi experienced in retaining control over these districts,\n",
      "after they had been incorporated in his empire. For in the forty-first\n",
      "year of his reign he was obliged to undertake the reconquest of\n",
      "Gankhar, and to send a third expedition there two years later; in the\n",
      "forty-third year he subdued Simuru for the third time, while in the\n",
      "forty-fourth year Anshan itself revolted and had to be regained by\n",
      "force of arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the course of these ten years it is probable that Dungi annexed the\n",
      "greater part of Elam, and placed his empire upon an enduring basis.\n",
      "It is true that during the closing years of his reign he undertook a\n",
      "fresh series of expeditions, conquering Shashru in the fifty-second\n",
      "year, subduing Simuru and Lulubu in the fifty-fourth year \"for the\n",
      "ninth time,\" and Urbillu, Kimash, Khumurti and Kharshi in the course\n",
      "of his last four years. But the earlier victories, by means of which\n",
      "he extended his sway far beyond the borders of Sumer and Akkad, may\n",
      "be held to mark the principal era of expansion in the growth of his\n",
      "empire. It was probably during this period that he added to his other\n",
      "titles the more comprehensive one of \"king of the four quarters (of\n",
      "the world),\" thus reviving a title which had already been adopted by\n",
      "NarÃ¢m-Sin at a time when the empire of Akkad had reached its zenith.\n",
      "Another innovation which Dungi introduced in the course of his reign,\n",
      "at a period it would seem shortly before his adoption of NarÃ¢m-Sin's\n",
      "title, was the assumption of divine rank, indicated by the addition of\n",
      "the determinative for divinity before his name. Like NarÃ¢m-Sin, who\n",
      "had claimed to be the god of Akkad, he styled himself the god of his\n",
      "land, and he founded temples in which his statue became the object\n",
      "of a public cult. He also established a national festival in his own\n",
      "honour, and renamed the seventh month of the year, during which it was\n",
      "celebrated, as the Month of the Feast of Dungi. He appears to have\n",
      "been the first Sumerian ruler to claim divine honours. By so doing he\n",
      "doubtless challenged comparison with the kings of Akkad, whose empire\n",
      "his conquests had enabled him to rival.\n",

      "towards the Sumerian domination of the country. In establishing his own\n",
      "authority in Elam, Dungi must have found many districts, and especially\n",
      "the city of Susa, influenced by Sumerian culture, though chiefly\n",
      "through the medium of Semitic immigrants from Northern Babylonia.\n",
      "His task of administering the conquered provinces was thus rendered\n",

      "upon the methods by which he administered the empire from his capital\n",
      "at Ur. Many of these documents contain orders for supplies allotted\n",
      "to officials in the king's service, who were passing through Lagash\n",
      "in the course of journeys between Ur and their districts in Elam. The\n",
      "tablets enumerate quantities of grain, strong drink and oil, which had\n",
      "been assigned to them, either for their sustenance during their stay in\n",
      "Lagash, or as provision for their journey after their departure.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is interesting to note that the towns or countries, from which\n",
      "they came, or to which they set out on their return journey from\n",
      "Ur, are generally specified. In addition to Susa, we meet with the\n",
      "names of Anshan, Kharishi, Kimash and Markharshi, the conquest or\n",
      "annexation of which by Dungi, as we have already seen, is recorded in\n",
      "the date-formulÃ¦. Other places, the officials of which are mentioned,\n",
      "were Khukhnuri, Shimash, Sabu, Ulu, Urri, Zaula, Gisha, Siri, Siu,\n",
      "Nekhune, and Sigiresh. Like the preceding districts, these were all\n",
      "in Elam, while Az, Shabara, Simashgi, Makhar and Adamdun, with which\n",
      "other officers were connected, probably lay in the same region.[16]\n",
      "From the number of separate places, the names of which have already\n",
      "been recovered on the tablets from Tello, it is clear that Dungi's\n",
      "authority in Elam was not confined to a few of the principal cities,\n",
      "but was effectively established throughout the greater part of the\n",
      "country. While much of his administrative work was directed from Ur,\n",
      "it is probable that Susa formed his local capital. From inscriptions\n",
      "found during the French excavations on that site we know that Dungi\n",
      "rebuilt there the temple of Shushinak the national god,[17] and it may\n",
      "be inferred that he made the city his headquarters during his periods\n",
      "of residence in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "The functions of many of the officials it is difficult to determine,\n",
      "but some of the titles that can be explained include couriers and\n",
      "royal messengers, who were entrusted with despatches. In the case of\n",
      "officials of a higher grade the object of their mission is sometimes\n",
      "indicated on the tablet, and it is seen that the majority superintended\n",
      "the collection and distribution of supplies, the transport of building\n",
      "materials, and the provision of labour for the public works undertaken\n",
      "by the king. In fact, a very large number of the royal officers were\n",
      "employed in recruiting public slaves in Elam, and in transporting them\n",
      "to Ur and other cities, for work upon temples and palaces in course of\n",
      "construction. From the situation of Lagash on the high-road between Ur\n",
      "and Susa, it is natural that the majority of the officials mentioned\n",
      "on the tablets should be on their way to or from Elam, but some whose\n",
      "business lay in other directions are occasionally mentioned. Thus\n",
      "certain of them were from towns in the immediate neighbourhood of\n",
      "Lagash, such as Tig-abba, while others journeyed northward to Nippur.\n",
      "Others, again, were on their way south to the coast, and even to the\n",
      "island of Dilmun in the Persian Gulf.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the higher officials whose stay in Lagash is recorded, or whose\n",
      "representatives passed through the city on business, a prefect, a local\n",
      "governor, and even a patesi are sometimes mentioned, and from this\n",
      "source of information we learn the names of some of the patesis who\n",
      "ruled in Susa under the suzerainty of Dungi and his successors on the\n",
      "throne of Ur. Thus several of the tablets record the supply of rations\n",
      "for Urkium, patesi of Susa, on his way back to that city during Dungi's\n",
      "reign. Another tablet mentions a servant of Zarik, patesi of Susa, who\n",
      "had come from Nippur, while a third patesi of Susa, who owed allegiance\n",
      "to one of the later kings of Ur, was Beli-arik.[18] It is noteworthy\n",
      "that these names, like that of Lipum, patesi of Anshan, who is also\n",
      "mentioned, are not Elamite but Semitic Babylonian, while Ur-gigir and\n",
      "Nagidda, who were patesis of Adamdun during this period, are Sumerian.\n",
      "It is therefore clear that, on his conquest of Elam, Dungi deposed\n",
      "the native rulers and replaced them by officials from Babylonia, a\n",
      "practice continued by his successors on the throne. In this we may see\n",
      "conclusive evidence of the permanent and detailed control over the\n",
      "administration of the country, which was secured by the later kings\n",
      "of Ur. Such a policy no doubt resulted in a very effective system of\n",
      "government, but its success depended on the maintenance of a sufficient\n",
      "force to overawe any signs of opposition. That the Elamites themselves\n",
      "resented the foreign domination is clear from the number of military\n",
      "expeditions, which were required to stamp out rebellions and reconquer\n",
      "provinces in revolt. The harsh methods adopted by the conquerors were\n",
      "not calculated to secure any loyal acceptance of their rule on the part\n",
      "of the subject race, and to this cause we may probably trace the events\n",
      "which led not only to the Elamite revival but to the downfall of the\n",
      "Dynasty of Ur itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is clear that Elam under Dungi's administration formed a rich source\n",
      "of supply for those material products, in the lavish display of which\n",
      "the later rulers of Sumer loved to indulge. Her quarries, mines, and\n",
      "forests were laid under contribution, and her cities were despoiled\n",
      "of their accumulated wealth in the course of the numerous military\n",
      "expeditions by which her provinces were overrun. From the spoil of his\n",
      "campaigns Dungi was enabled to enrich the temples of his own land, and\n",
      "by appropriating the products of the country he obtained an abundance\n",
      "of metal, stone and wood for the construction and adornment of his\n",
      "buildings. Large bodies of public slaves supplied the necessary labour,\n",
      "and their ranks were constantly recruited from among the captives\n",
      "taken in battle, and from towns and villages which were suspected of\n",
      "participation in revolts. He was thus enabled to continue, on an even\n",
      "more elaborate scale, the rebuilding of the ancient temples of his\n",

      "throughout Sumer and Akkad, but also in the outlying provinces of his\n",
      "empire. In the provincial cities the scribes frequently added to the\n",
      "date-formula the name of their local patesi, who was in office at the\n",
      "time, and from such notes upon the Tello tablets we obtain the names\n",
      "of four patesis of Lagash who were Dungi's contemporaries during the\n",
      "last twenty years he occupied the throne. Similarly on tablets found\n",
      "at JÃ´kha[23] we learn that in the forty-fourth year of Dungi's reign\n",
      "Ur-nesu was patesi of the city of Umma; while a seal-impression on\n",
      "another tablet from Tello supplies the name of Ur-Pasag, who was patesi\n",
      "of the city of Dungi-Babbar. The sealings upon tablets of the period\n",
      "afford some indication of the decrease in influence attaching to the\n",
      "office of patesi, which resulted from the centralization of authority\n",
      "in Ur. Subordinate officials could employ Dungi's name, not that of\n",
      "their local patesi, upon their seals of office, proving that, like the\n",
      "patesi himself, they held their appointments direct from the king.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the patesis who held office in Lagash during Dungi's earlier years,\n",
      "the name of only one, a certain Galu-kazal, has been recovered. He\n",
      "dedicated a vase to Ningirsu for the preservation of Dungi's life,[24]\n",
      "and his daughter Khala-Lama presented a remarkable female statuette\n",
      "to the goddess Bau with the same object.[25] Of the later patesis we\n",
      "know that Galu-andul was in office during the thirty-ninth year of\n",
      "Dungi's reign, and that Ur-Lama I. ruled for at least seven years from\n",
      "his forty-second to his forty-eighth year. The patesiate of Alla, who\n",
      "was in office during his fiftieth year, was very short, for he was\n",
      "succeeded in the following year by Ur-Lama II., who survived Dungi\n",
      "and continued to rule in Lagash for three, and possibly four, years\n",
      "of BÃ»r-Sin's reign. Among the public works undertaken by Dungi in\n",
      "Lagash, we know that he rebuilt E-ninnÃ», Ningirsu's temple, the great\n",
      "temple dedicated to the goddess NinÃ¢, and E-salgilsa, the shrine of the\n",
      "goddess Ninmar in Girsu. Excavations upon other sites will doubtless\n",
      "reveal traces of the other buildings, which he erected in the course\n",
      "of his long reign of fifty-eight years. Indeed, the texts already\n",
      "recovered contain references to work on buildings, the sites of which\n",
      "are not yet identified, such as the restoration of Ubara, and the\n",
      "founding of Bad-mada, \"The Wall (or Fortification) of the Land.\" As the\n",
      "latter was constructed in his forty-seventh year, after the principal\n",
      "epoch of his Elamite campaigns, it may have been a strongly fortified\n",
      "garrison-town upon the frontier, from which he could exercise control\n",
      "over his recently acquired provinces.\n",
      "\n",
      "In view of Dungi's exceptionally long reign, it is probable that\n",
      "BÃ»r-Sin was already advanced in years when he succeeded his father\n",
      "upon the throne of Ur. However this may be, he reigned for only\n",
      "nine years, and Gimil-Sin, his son who succeeded him, for only seven\n",
      "years.[26] A longer reign was that of Ibi-Sin, Gimil-Sin's son and\n",
      "successor, who held his throne for a generation, but finally lost it\n",
      "and brought Ur-Engur's dynasty to an inglorious end. These last rulers\n",
      "of the Dynasty of Ur appear to have maintained the general lines of\n",
      "Dungi's policy, which they inherited from him along with his empire.\n",
      "The Elamite provinces required to be kept in check by the sending of\n",
      "military expeditions thither, but in Babylonia itself the rule of\n",
      "Ur was accepted without question, and her kings were free to devote\n",
      "themselves to the adornment of the great temples in the land. It is of\n",
      "interest to note that under BÃ»r-Sin and his son the importance of the\n",
      "central shrine of Nippur was fully recognized, and emphasis was laid\n",
      "on Enlil's position at the head of the Babylonian pantheon. Evidence\n",
      "of this may be seen in the additional titles, which these two rulers\n",
      "adopted in their foundation-inscriptions and votive texts that have\n",
      "come down to us. BÃ»r-Sin's regular titles of \"King of Ur, king of the\n",
      "four quarters\" are generally preceded by the phrase \"whose name Enlil\n",
      "has pronounced in Nippur, who raised the head of Enlil's temple,\" while\n",
      "Gimil-Sin describes himself as \"the beloved of Enlil,\" \"whom Enlil\n",
      "has chosen as his heart's beloved,\" or \"whom Enlil in his heart has\n",
      "chosen to be the shepherd of the land and of the four quarters.\" From\n",
      "inscriptions found at Nippur we know that BÃ»r-Sin added to the great\n",
      "temple of E-kur, and also built a storehouse for offerings of honey,\n",
      "butter and wine, while his third year was dated by the construction\n",
      "of a great throne in Enlil's honour. Gimil-Sin appears to have been\n",
      "equally active in his devotion to the shrine, for two years of his\n",
      "short reign derive their titles from the setting up of a great stele\n",
      "and the construction of a sacred boat, both in honour of Enlil and his\n",
      "consort.\n",
      "\n",
      "The peculiar honour paid to Enlil does not appear to have affected the\n",
      "cult of the Moon-god, the patron deity of Ur, for both BÃ»r-Sin and\n",
      "Gimil-Sin rebuilt and added to the great temple of Sin, or Nannar,\n",
      "in their capital.[27] They also followed Dungi in his care for the\n",
      "shrine of Enki at Eridu; and there is evidence that BÃ»r-Sin rebuilt\n",
      "the temple of Ninni at Erech, while the last year of Gimil-Sin's reign\n",
      "was signalized by the rebuilding of the city-temple at Umma. It is\n",
      "thus clear that the later members of Ur-Engur's dynasty continued\n",
      "the rebuilding of the temples of Babylonia, which characterized his\n",
      "reign and that of Dungi. Another practice which they inherited was\n",
      "the deification of the reigning king. Not only did they assume the\n",
      "divine determinative before their names, but BÃ»r-Sin styles himself\n",
      "\"the righteous god of his land,\" or \"the righteous god, the sun of his\n",
      "land.\" He also set up a statue of himself, which he named \"BÃ»r-Sin,\n",
      "the beloved of Ur,\" and placed it in the temple of the Moon-god under\n",
      "the protection of Nannar and Ningal. It would seem that it became the\n",
      "custom at this time for the reigning king to erect statues of himself\n",
      "in the great temples of the land, where regular offerings were made to\n",
      "them as to the statues of the gods themselves. Thus a tablet from Tello\n",
      "mentions certain offerings made at the Feast of the New Moon to statues\n",
      "of Gimil-Sin, which stood in the two principal temples of Lagash,\n",
      "those of Ningirsu and the goddess Bau.[28] It should be added that the\n",
      "tablet is dated in the fifth year of Gimil-Sin's reign. In view of\n",
      "Nannar's rank as god of the suzerain city, the Feasts of the New Moon\n",
      "were naturally regarded, even in the provincial cities, as of peculiar\n",
      "importance in the sacred calendar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever the king rebuilt or added to a temple we may assume that\n",
      "he inaugurated there a new centre of his cult, but it is certain\n",
      "that temples were also erected which were devoted entirely to his\n",
      "worship. Thus Dungi dated a year of his reign by the appointment of\n",
      "a high-priest of his own cult, an act which suggests that on his\n",
      "assumption of divine rank he founded a temple in his own honour.\n",
      "Moreover, under his successors high officials sought the royal\n",
      "favour by building and dedicating shrines to the reigning king. This\n",
      "is proved by a votive inscription of Lugal-magurri, the patesi of Ur\n",
      "and commander of the fortress, which records that he founded a temple\n",
      "in honour of Gimil-Sin, \"his god.\" At the king's death his cult did\n",
      "not die with him, but he continued to be worshipped and offerings were\n",
      "made to him at the Feast of the New Moon. Tablets from Tello, dated\n",
      "during the later years of the Dynasty of Ur, record the making of such\n",
      "offerings to Dungi, and it is noteworthy that the patesis Ur-Lama and\n",
      "Gudea were also honoured in the same way. We have seen that Gudea\n",
      "was probably not deified in his own lifetime, but at this period he\n",
      "takes his place beside the god Dunpae in the rites of the New Moon.\n",
      "Offerings in his honour, accompanied by sacrifices, were repeated\n",
      "six times a year, and a special class of priests was attached to his\n",
      "service.[29] An interesting survival, or trace, of this practice occurs\n",
      "in an explanatory list of gods, drawn up for Ashur-bani-pal's Library\n",
      "at Nineveh, where BÃ»r-Sin's name is explained as that of an attendant\n",

      "Of the comparatively long reign of Ibi-Sin, and of the events which\n",
      "preceded the downfall of the Dynasty of Ur, we know little, but already\n",
      "during the reigns of his predecessors it is possible to trace some of\n",
      "the causes which led to the decline of the city's power. The wealth\n",
      "obtained from the Elamite provinces and the large increase in the\n",
      "number of public slaves must have introduced an element of luxury into\n",
      "Sumerian life, which would tend to undermine the military qualities of\n",
      "the people and their inclination for foreign service. The incorporation\n",
      "of Sumer and Akkad into a single empire had broken down the last traces\n",
      "of political division between the great cities of the land, and,\n",
      "while it had put an end to local patriotism, it had not encouraged in\n",
      "its place the growth of any feeling of loyalty to the suzerain city.\n",
      "All the great provincial towns were doubtless required to furnish\n",
      "contingents for the numerous military campaigns of the period, and\n",
      "they could have had little satisfaction in seeing the fruits of their\n",
      "conquests diverted to the aggrandizement of a city other than their\n",
      "own. The assumption of divine rank by the later kings of Ur may in\n",
      "itself be regarded as a symptom of the spirit which governed their\n",
      "administration. In the case of Dungi the innovation had followed the\n",
      "sudden expansion of his empire, and its adoption had been based upon\n",
      "political as much as upon personal grounds. But with his descendants\n",
      "the practice had been carried to more extravagant lengths, and it\n",
      "undoubtedly afforded opportunities for royal favourities to obtain by\n",
      "flattery an undue influence in the state.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have already seen that Lugal-magurri, who combined the civil office\n",
      "of patesi of Ur with the military appointment of commander of the\n",
      "fortress, founded a temple for the worship of Gimil-Sin, and it is\n",
      "clear that such an act would have opened an easier road to the royal\n",
      "favour than the successful prosecution of a campaign. It was probably\n",
      "by such methods that ministers at the court of Ur secured the enjoyment\n",
      "of a plurality of offices, which had previously been administered\n",
      "with far greater efficiency in separate hands. The most striking\n",
      "example is afforded by Arad-Nannar, whose name as that of a patesi of\n",
      "Lagash is frequently mentioned upon dated tablets from Tello. He was\n",
      "\"sukkal-makh,\" or chief minister, under the last three kings of Ur, and\n",
      "appears to have succeeded his father Ur-Dunpae, who had held this post\n",
      "in Dungi's reign. From the Tello tablets we know that he also held the\n",
      "patesiate of Lagash during this period, for he received the appointment\n",
      "towards the end of BÃ»r-Sin's reign[34] and continued to hold it under\n",
      "Ibi-Sin. But the patesiate of Lagash was only one of many posts which\n",
      "he combined. For two gate-sockets have been found at Tello, which\n",
      "originally formed parts of a temple founded in Girsu by Arad-Nannar for\n",
      "the cult of Gimil-Sin, and in the inscriptions upon them he has left us\n",
      "a list of his appointments.[35]\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to holding the posts of chief minister and patesi of\n",
      "Lagash, he was also priest of Enki, governor of Uzargarshana, governor\n",
      "of Babishue, patesi of Sabu and of the land of Gutebu, governor of\n",
      "Timat-Enlil, patesi of Al-Gimil-Sin,[36] governor of Urbillu, patesi\n",
      "of Khamasi and of Gankhar, governor of Ikhi, and governor of the\n",
      "Su-people and of the land of Kardaka. At some time during the reign of\n",
      "Gimil-Sin Arad-Nannar thus combined in his own person twelve important\n",
      "appointments, involving the administration of no less than thirteen\n",
      "separate cities and provinces. The position of some of the places\n",
      "enumerated is still uncertain, but it is clear that several were widely\n",
      "separated from one another. While Lagash, for instance, lay in the\n",
      "south of Sumer, Sabu was in Elam and Urbillu and Gankhar more to the\n",
      "north in the region of the Zagros mountains.\n",
      "\n",
      "This centralization of authority under the later kings of Ur\n",
      "undoubtedly destroyed the power attaching to the patesiate at a time\n",
      "when the separate cities of the land had enjoyed a practical autonomy;\n",
      "and it incidentally explains the survival of the title, under the\n",
      "First Dynasty of Babylon, as that of a comparatively subordinate class\n",
      "of officials. But the policy of centralization must have had a more\n",
      "immediate effect on the general administration of the empire. For it\n",
      "undoubtedly lessened the responsibilities of local governors, and it\n",
      "placed the central authority, which the king himself had previously\n",
      "enjoyed, in the hands of a few officials of the court. The king's\n",
      "deification undoubtedly tended to encourage his withdrawal from the\n",
      "active control of affairs, and, so long as his divine rites were duly\n",
      "celebrated, he was probably content to accept without question the\n",
      "reports his courtiers presented to him. Such a system of government was\n",

      "The kingdom of Sumer and Akkad, which had been founded by Ur-Engur,\n",
      "survived the fall of his dynasty, and the centre of authority merely\n",
      "passed from one city to another. The change of capital did not imply\n",
      "the existence of any new racial movement, such as that which had led\n",
      "to the rise of Kish and the Empire of Akkad. The kings of Isin were\n",
      "probably Sumerians like their immediate predecessors, and they shared\n",
      "with them the same ideals and culture. No doubt a rivalry existed\n",
      "between the great Sumerian cities, and any one of them would have\n",
      "been ready to contest the power of Ur had there been a prospect of\n",
      "success. At first sight indeed it might appear that Isin now emerged\n",
      "as the victor from such a struggle for the hegemony. In the dynastic\n",
      "chronicle from Nippur the close of the Dynasty of Ur and the rise of\n",
      "Isin is briefly recorded in the words \"the rule of Ur was overthrown,\n",
      "Isin took its kingdom.\" From this passage alone it might be imagined\n",
      "that Ishbi-Ura, the founder of the Dynasty of Isin, had headed a revolt\n",
      "against the rule of Ur, and had been the direct agent in Ibi-Sin's\n",
      "deposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the fall of the Dynasty of Ur, like that of the First Dynasty of\n",
      "Babylon, was due to an external cause and not to any movement within\n",
      "the limits of Babylonia itself. We possess no contemporary record of\n",
      "the catastrophe which at this time overwhelmed the empire, but an echo\n",
      "of it has been preserved in an omen-text, inscribed upon an Assyrian\n",
      "tablet from the Library of Ashur-bani-pal. We have already noted\n",
      "instances in which genuine historical traditions have been incorporated\n",
      "in the later augural literature, and we need have no hesitation in\n",
      "accepting the historical accuracy of this reference to past events.\n",
      "The text in question enumerates certain omens which it associates with\n",
      "the fall of \"Ibi-Sin, the King of Ur,\" who, it states, was carried\n",
      "captive to Anshan.[1] We may thus infer that it was an Elamite invasion\n",
      "that put an end to the Dynasty of Ur. The foreign provinces, on the\n",
      "possession of which Dungi had based his claim to the rule of the four\n",
      "quarters of the world, had finally proved the cause of his empire's\n",
      "downfall.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have few data on which to form an estimate of the extent of the\n",
      "Elamite conquest of Babylonia, or of the period during which the\n",
      "country or a portion of it was in the hands of the invaders. The\n",
      "deportation of the king of Ur can hardly have been the result of a\n",
      "spasmodic raid, following one of the numerous provincial revolts which\n",
      "had at last proved successful. It is far more likely that the capture\n",
      "followed the fall of Ur itself, and such an achievement argues the\n",
      "existence of an organized force in Elam, which it must have required\n",
      "some years to build up. It is therefore permissible to conjecture\n",
      "that, in the course of the twenty-five years of his reign, Ibi-Sin had\n",
      "gradually been losing his hold upon the Elamite portion of his empire,\n",
      "and that an independent kingdom had been formed in Elam under a native\n",
      "ruler. For a time Ibi-Sin may have continued to hold certain districts,\n",
      "but, after the successful invasion of Babylonia, the whole of Elam, and\n",
      "for a time a part of Babylonia itself, may have fallen to the lot of\n",
      "the conqueror.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be tempting to connect the fall of Ur with the sack of the\n",
      "neighbouring city of Erech by the Elamite king Kudur-Nankhundi, which\n",
      "is referred to in an inscription of Ashur-bani-pal. When he captured\n",
      "Susa in 650 B.C., the Assyrian king relates that he recovered the\n",
      "image of the goddess NanÃ¢, which Kudur-Nankhundi had carried off from\n",
      "Erech sixteen hundred and thirty-five years before.[2] By accepting\n",
      "these figures Kudur-Nankhundi's invasion has been assigned to an\n",
      "approximate date of 2285 B.C., and it was formerly supposed that it\n",
      "was an episode in the Elamite wars of the First Dynasty of Babylon.\n",
      "But, in consequence of the reduction in dates necessitated by recent\n",
      "discoveries, it follows that, if Ashur-bani-pal's figures be accepted\n",
      "as correct, Kudur-Nankhundi's invasion must have taken place before the\n",
      "rise of Babylon. It cannot have occurred at a time when the kings of Ur\n",
      "were all-powerful in Babylonia, and still retained an effective hold on\n",
      "Elam; so that, unless we assign the invasion to some period of unrest\n",
      "during the Dynasty of Isin, no more probable epoch presents itself than\n",
      "that of the Elamite invasion which put an end to the Dynasty of Ur, and\n",
      "allowed Isin to secure the hegemony in Babylonia.\n",
      "\n",
      "The want of some synchronism, or fixed point of contact, between\n",
      "the earlier history of Elam and that of Sumer and Akkad renders it\n",
      "difficult to settle the period of those native Elamite rulers whose\n",
      "names occur in building-inscriptions, recovered during the French\n",
      "excavations at Susa. Some of the texts enumerate a succession of\n",
      "Elamite princes, who had in turn taken part in the reconstruction of\n",
      "buildings in that city,[3] and, although we are thus enabled to arrange\n",
      "their names in relative chronological order, it is not until towards\n",
      "the close of the First Dynasty of Babylon that we can definitely fix\n",
      "the date of any one of them. Of earlier rulers, the members of the\n",
      "dynasty of Khutran-tepti probably reigned at a period subsequent to\n",
      "that of Basha-Shushinak.[4] In addition to Khutran-tepti himself, the\n",
      "names of three of his descendants have been recovered, Itaddu I.,\n",
      "and his son Kal-Rukhuratir, and his grandson Itaddu II. Since these\n",
      "rulers bore the title patesi of Susa, it is possible that, like Urkium,\n",
      "Zarik and Belia-rik, who are mentioned on tablets from Tello,[5] they\n",
      "owed allegiance to Babylonia, during the period of the Dynasty of\n",
      "Ur.[6] A later Elamite dynasty was that which traced its descent from\n",
      "Ebarti, or from his son Shilkhakha. Two of Shilkhakha's descendants[7]\n",
      "were Shirukdu' or Shirukdukh, and Simebalar-khuppak, and these were\n",
      "divided from a later group by Kuk-Kirmesh, the son of Lankuku. The\n",
      "later group of his descendants, whose names have yet been recovered,\n",
      "consists of Adda-Pakshu, Temti-khalki and Kuk-Nashur, or Kukka-Nasher,\n",
      "the descendant of Kal-Uli.[8] What intervals of time separated the\n",
      "different members of the dynasty from one another is still a matter for\n",
      "conjecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is noteworthy that the members of Ebarti's dynasty, whose\n",
      "inscriptions have been recovered, bear different titles to those of the\n",
      "earlier dynasty of Khutran-tepti. While the latter styled themselves\n",
      "patesis of Susa and governors (_shakkanakku_) of Elam, their successors\n",
      "claim the title of _sukkal_ of Elam, of Simash, and of Susa. It has\n",
      "been suggested that the title of _sukkallu_ may have carried with it an\n",
      "idea of independence from foreign control, which is absent from that\n",
      "of patesi, and the alteration of title has been regarded as reflecting\n",
      "a corresponding change in the political condition of Elam. The view\n",
      "has been put forward that the rulers of Elam, who styled themselves\n",
      "_sukkallu_, reigned at a period when Elam was independent and possibly\n",
      "exercised suzerainty over the neighbouring districts of Babylonia.[9]\n",
      "The worker of this change was assumed to be Kudur-Nankhundi, and\n",
      "in support of the suggestion it was pointed out that a certain\n",
      "Kutir-Nakhkhunte, whose name occurs in a votive inscription of the\n",
      "period, should possibly be identified with the conqueror of Erech.\n",
      "He is mentioned on inscribed bricks of Temti-agun, a sukkal of Susa\n",
      "and a descendant of Shirukdukh, from a temple built by this ruler\n",
      "with the object of prolonging his own life and those of four other\n",
      "Elamites, among them Kutir-Nakhkhunte.[10] It was thought possible that\n",
      "Temti-agun might have been the local ruler of Susa, at a time when\n",
      "Kutir-Nakhkhunte exercised control over the whole of Elam and a great\n",
      "part of Babylonia.\n",
      "\n",
      "The suggested synchronism, if established, would have been of\n",
      "considerable assistance in arranging the chronology of an obscure\n",
      "period of history, but it cannot be regarded as probable. Temti-agun\n",
      "sets no title after Kutir-Nakhkhunte's name, an omission that is\n",
      "hardly compatible with the theory that he was his superior and\n",
      "suzerain. Moreover, it is now certain that the title of _sukkallu_, so\n",
      "far from implying a measure of independence, was a distinctive mark\n",
      "of subjection to foreign control. For an inscription of the sukkal\n",
      "Kukka-Nasher has recently been published,[11] which is dated by a\n",
      "formula of Ammi-zaduga, the last king but one of the first Babylonian\n",
      "dynasty, proving that he governed Susa in Ammi-zaduga's name. This\n",
      "synchronism is the only certain one in the early history of the two\n",
      "countries, for it probably disposes of another recently suggested\n",
      "between Adda-Pakshu and Sumu-abu, the founder of the Babylonian\n",
      "monarchy. A contract-tablet of the epoch of Adda-Pakshu is dated\n",
      "in \"the year of Shumu-abi,\" who has been identified with Sumu-abu,\n",
      "the Babylonian king.[12] Apart from the fact that no title follows\n",
      "Shumu-abi's name, it has been pointed out that a far shorter interval\n",
      "separated Adda-Pakshu from Kuk-Nashur.[13] We are therefore reduced to\n",
      "the conclusion that at any rate the later members of Ebarti's dynasty\n",
      "owed allegiance to Babylon, and it is a legitimate assumption that the\n",
      "earlier rulers, who also bore the title of _sukkallu_, acknowledged\n",
      "the suzerainty of either Babylon or Isin. The control exercised by the\n",
      "sovereign state was doubtless often nominal, and it is probable that\n",
      "border warfare was not of infrequent occurrence. A reflection of such\n",
      "a state of affairs may probably be seen in the short inscription of\n",
      "Anu-mutabil, a governor of the city of Der, which he engraved upon an\n",
      "olive-shaped stone now in the British Museum.[14] This local magnate,\n",
      "who probably lived at about the period of the Dynasty of Isin, boasts\n",
      "that he broke the heads of the men of Anshan, Elam and Simash, and\n",
      "conquered Barakhsu.\n",
      "\n",
      "We thus obtain from native Elamite sources no evidence that Elam\n",
      "exercised control over a portion of Babylonia for any considerable\n",
      "period after the fall of Ur. The invasion of the country, which\n",
      "resulted in the deportation of Ibi-Sin, no doubt freed Elam for a time\n",
      "from foreign control, and may well have led to the establishment of a\n",
      "number of independent states under native Elamite rulers. In addition\n",
      "to Kudur-Nankhundi we may provisionally assign to this period KisÃ¢ri,\n",
      "king of Gankhar,[15] a district which had previously been held by the\n",
      "kings of Ur. But it would seem that the Elamite states, after their\n",
      "long period of subjection, were not sufficiently strong or united to\n",
      "follow up the success achieved by Anshan. The dynastic chronicle from\n",
      "Nippur records that Isin took the kingdom of Ur, and we may assume that\n",
      "Ishbi-Ura was not long in re-establishing the kingdom of Sumer and\n",
      "Akkad with his own city as its capital. The Elamite invasion may well\n",
      "have been confined to the south of Sumer, and among the cities that had\n",
      "been left unaffected the most powerful would naturally assert itself.\n",
      "Evidence that Ishbi-Ura soon freed himself from Elamite interference\n",
      "may possibly be seen in a reference to him upon an Assyrian\n",
      "omen-tablet, which states that \"he had no rivals.\"[16] The phrase is\n",
      "certainly vague, but it at least bears witness to the reputation which\n",
      "his achievements secured for him in the traditions of a later age.\n",
      "\n",
      "We possess few records of the kings of Isin, and the greater part of\n",
      "our information concerning the dynasty is furnished by the Nippur\n",
      "dynastic list. From this document we know that it lasted for two\n",
      "hundred and twenty-five years and six months, and consisted of sixteen\n",
      "kings. These fall naturally into four groups. The first group comprises\n",
      "the family of Ishbi-Ura, four of whose direct descendants succeeded\n",
      "him upon the throne, their reigns together with his occupying a period\n",
      "of ninety-four years. The second group consists of Ur-Ninib and three\n",
      "of his descendants, who reigned for sixty-one years. Then followed\n",
      "a period of thirty-six and a half years, during which no less than\n",
      "five kings ruled in Isin, and, since none of them were related, it\n",
      "was clearly a time of great political unrest. A more stable condition\n",
      "of things appears to have prevailed during the closing period of\n",
      "thirty-four years, occupied by the reigns of Sin-magir and his son\n",
      "Damik-ilishu, under whom the dynasty came to an end. A number of\n",
      "tablets dated during the Dynasty of Isin have been found at Niffer,\n",
      "and at least one at AbÃ» Habba, while a few short votive inscriptions\n",
      "of some of the kings themselves have been recovered on these two sites\n",
      "and also at Ur and Babylon. References to four of the kings of Isin\n",
      "in later Babylonian traditions complete the material from which a\n",
      "knowledge of the period can be obtained. The information derived from\n",
      "these rather scanty sources, combined with the succession of rulers\n",
      "on the Nippur list, enables us to sketch in outline the progress of\n",
      "events, but it naturally leaves many problems unsettled, for the\n",
      "solution of which we must await further discoveries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The late tradition of Ishbi-Ura's successful reign is supported by\n",
      "the fact that he ruled for thirty-two years and firmly established\n",
      "his own family upon the throne of Isin. He was succeeded by his\n",
      "son Gimil-ilishu, who reigned for ten years. A very fragmentary\n",
      "inscription of Idin-Dagan, the son of Gimil-ilishu, who reigned for\n",
      "twenty-one years, has been found at AbÃ» Habba,[17] proving that Sippar\n",
      "acknowledged his authority. Indeed, it is probable that already in\n",
      "Ishbi-Ura's reign Akkad as well as Sumer formed part of the kingdom\n",
      "of Isin, and evidence that this was the normal state of affairs may\n",
      "be seen in the fact that each king of Isin, of whom we possess a\n",
      "building-inscription or a votive text, lays claim to the title of\n",
      "King of Sumer and Akkad. The earliest record of this character is an\n",
      "inscription upon bricks found at Mukayyar and dating from the reign\n",
      "of Ishme-Dagan, the son and successor of Idin-Dagan. In addition to\n",
      "his titles of King of Isin and King of Sumer and Akkad, he styles\n",
      "himself Lord of Erech and records in various phrases the favour he\n",
      "has shown to the cities of Nippur, Ur, and Eridu; while his building\n",
      "activity at Nippur is attested by numerous bricks bearing his name and\n",
      "titles, which have been found on that site. The same cities are also\n",
      "mentioned in the titles borne by Libit-Ishtar, Ishme-Dagan's son, who\n",
      "succeeded to the throne after his father had reigned for twenty years.\n",
      "Both these rulers appear to have devoted themselves to the cult of\n",
      "Ninni, the great goddess of Erech, and Ishme-Dagan even styles himself\n",
      "her \"beloved spouse.\" His claim to be the consort of the goddess was\n",
      "doubtless based on his assumption of divine rank, a practice which the\n",

      "established himself in Isin, and for six months retained the throne.\n",
      "But at the end of this time Enlil-bani succeeded in ousting him from\n",
      "that position, and, having secured the throne himself, he continued\n",
      "to reign in Isin for twenty-four years. As he had been called to the\n",
      "throne by Ura-imitti, he cannot be regarded as a usurper, but he\n",
      "did not succeed in establishing a settled dynasty. Zambia,[27] who\n",
      "followed him, was a usurper, and after only three years he was in turn\n",
      "displaced. Two other usurpers held the throne for five and four years\n",

      "During this period of confusion it is probable that the internal\n",
      "troubles of Isin reacted upon her political influence in Babylonia. It\n",
      "is also possible that the quick changes in the succession may have, in\n",
      "part, been brought about by events which were happening in other cities\n",
      "of Sumer and Akkad.[28] It has, indeed, been suggested that the Dynasty\n",
      "of Isin and the First Dynasty of Babylon overlapped each other,[29]\n",
      "as is proved to have been the case with the first three dynasties of\n",
      "the Babylonian List of Kings. If that were so, not only the earlier\n",
      "kings of Babylon, but also the kings of Larsa and the less powerful\n",
      "kings of Erech, would all have been reigning contemporaneously with the\n",
      "later kings of Isin. In fact, we should picture the kingdom of Sumer\n",
      "and Akkad as divided into a number of smaller principalities, each\n",
      "vying with the other in a contest for the hegemony, and maintaining\n",
      "a comparatively independent rule within their own borders. Such a\n",
      "condition of affairs would amply account for the confusion in the\n",
      "succession at Isin, and our scanty knowledge of the period could be\n",
      "supplemented from our sources of information concerning the history of\n",
      "the earlier kings of Babylon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The view is certainly attractive, but for that very reason it is\n",
      "necessary to examine carefully the grounds upon which it is based.\n",
      "For deciding the inter-relations of the first three dynasties of the\n",
      "Babylonian King-List, we have certain definite synchronisms established\n",
      "between members of the different dynasties.[30] But between the kings\n",
      "of Babylon and Isin no such synchronism has been furnished by the\n",
      "texts. The theory that the two dynasties were partly contemporaneous\n",
      "rests upon data which admit of more than one interpretation, while\n",
      "additional reasons adduced in its support have since been discredited.\n",

      "The principal fact upon which those who accept the theory rely is that\n",
      "a capture of the city of Isin is commemorated in the formula for the\n",
      "seventeenth year of Sin-muballit, the fifth king of the First Dynasty\n",
      "of Babylon and the father of Hammurabi.[31] Now a capture of the city\n",
      "of Isin by RÃ®m-Sin, King of Larsa, is also recorded in formulas upon\n",
      "contract-tablets found at Tell Sifr, and that considerable importance\n",
      "was attached locally to this event is attested by the fact that it\n",
      "formed an epoch for dating tablets in that district.[32] The theory\n",
      "necessitates two assumptions, the first to the effect that the\n",
      "date-formulÃ¦ of RÃ®m-Sin and Sin-muballit refer to the same capture\n",
      "of the city; and, secondly, that this event brought the Dynasty of\n",
      "Isin to an end. Granting these hypotheses, the twenty-third year of\n",
      "Damik-ilishu would have coincided with the seventeenth year of\n",
      "Sin-muballit, and the dynasties of Isin and of Babylon would have\n",
      "overlapped for a period of about ninety-nine years. Thus Sumu-abu,\n",
      "the founder of the first Babylonian dynasty, would have been the\n",
      "contemporary of BÃ»r-Sin II., king of Isin, in the sixth year of whose\n",
      "reign he would have ascended the throne of Babylon. By the acceptance\n",
      "of the theory, not only would the relations of the two dynasties be\n",

      "not uncommon name should be identified with the king of Isin. It has\n",
      "further been pointed out that another tablet in the British Museum,[34]\n",
      "of about the same period, contains a reference to a Libit-Ishtar who\n",
      "was certainly not the king of Isin, but appears to have occupied the\n",
      "important post of governor of a provincial city, probably Sippar.[35]\n",
      "The writer of this tablet recounts how he had been imprisoned and had\n",
      "appealed to Libit-Ishtar to try his case and set him free; but he was\n",
      "met with a refusal, and he afterwards made a similar appeal to Amananu,\n",
      "to whom he ascribes the title of governor. In this passage Libit-Ishtar\n",
      "has no title, but since appeals in legal cases could be referred to\n",
      "him, he may very probably have held the same office as Amananu, that of\n",
      "governor of the city. In certain contract-tablets of Apil-Sin's reign\n",
      "a Libit-Ishtar is also mentioned in the place of honour at the head of\n",

      "arguments deduced from the tablet for the overlapping of the dynasties\n",
      "of Isin and of Babylon no longer apply.\n",
      "\n",
      "There only remain to be discussed the original grounds for the\n",
      "suggestion that Damik-ilishu was Sin-muballit's contemporary, and\n",
      "that the fall of the Dynasty of Isin is to be set in the seventeenth\n",

      "seventeenth year of the latter's reign to have captured the city of\n",
      "Isin. From the chronicle concerning early Babylonian kings we already\n",
      "knew that he was not finally defeated in Hammurabi's thirty-first year,\n",
      "but lived on into the reign of Samsu-iluna, by whom he was apparently\n",
      "defeated or slain.[37] It is true that the passage is broken, and it\n",
      "has been suggested that the record concerns the son of RÃ®m-Sin, and not\n",
      "RÃ®m-Sin himself.[38] But it has now been pointed out that two of the\n",
      "contract-tablets found at Tell Sifr, which appear to record the same\n",
      "act of sale, and are inscribed with the names of the same witnesses,\n",
      "are dated, the one by RÃ®m-Sin, the other in Samsu-iluna's tenth\n",
      "year.[39] However we may explain the existence of these two nearly\n",
      "identical copies of the same document, their dates certainly imply\n",
      "that RÃ®m-Sin was in possession of a portion of Babylonia at least as\n",
      "late as the ninth year of Samsu-iluna's reign.[40] If, therefore, he\n",
      "captured Isin in the seventeenth year of Sin-muballit, Samsu-iluna's\n",
      "grandfather, we must suppose that his military activity in Babylonia\n",

      "longer. Such an achievement is within the bounds of possibility, but it\n",
      "cannot be regarded as probable.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, quite apart from this objection, there are small grounds for\n",
      "the belief that Sin-muballit was RÃ®m-Sin's vassal, or that they\n",
      "could have taken part in any united action at this period. In fact,\n",
      "every indication we have points to the conclusion that it was from\n",
      "a king of Larsa that Sin-muballit captured Isin in the seventeenth\n",
      "year of his reign.[41] Three years previously the date-formula for\n",
      "his fourteenth year commemorated his defeat of the army of Ur, and\n",
      "there are good grounds for believing that Ur was acting at this time\n",
      "with the army of the king of Larsa. For certain tablets are dated in\n",
      "the year in which Sin-muballit defeated the army of Larsa, and we\n",
      "may with some confidence regard this as a variant formula for the\n",
      "fourteenth year.[42] Thus, three years after his defeat of the king of\n",
      "Larsa, Sin-muballit followed up his success by capturing the city of\n",
      "Isin, which he commemorated in the formula for the seventeenth year.\n",
      "But he cannot have held it for long, for it must have been shortly\n",
      "retaken by Larsa, before being again recaptured in Hammurabi's seventh\n",
      "year.[43] Thus, in less than eleven years, from the seventeenth year of\n",
      "Sin-muballit to the seventh year of Hammurabi, the city of Isin changed\n",
      "hands three times. We may therefore conclude that the date-formula for\n",
      "Sin-muballit's seventeenth year, and those found upon the Tell Sifr\n",
      "tablets,[44] did not commemorate the fall of the Dynasty of Isin in\n",
      "Damik-ilishu's reign, but were based upon two episodes in the struggle\n",
      "for that city, which took place at a later date, between the kings of\n",
      "Larsa and of Babylon.\n",

      "In view of the importance of the question, we have treated in some\n",
      "detail the evidence that has been adduced in favour of the theory, that\n",
      "the later kings of Isin were contemporaneous with the earlier rulers\n",
      "of Babylon. It will have been seen that the difficulties involved by\n",
      "the suggested synchronism between Damik-ilishu and Sin-muballit are\n",
      "too grave to admit of its acceptance, while they entirely disappear\n",
      "on referring the disputed date-formulÃ¦ to their natural place in\n",
      "the struggle between Babylon and Larsa. This does not preclude the\n",
      "possibility that the dynasties may have overlapped for a shorter\n",
      "period than ninety-nine years. But in view of the total absence of any\n",
      "information on the point, it is preferable to retain the view that\n",
      "the Babylonian monarchy was not established before the close of the\n",
      "Dynasty of Isin.[45] Whatever troubles may have befallen Isin after\n",
      "Ur-Ninib's family had ceased to reign, there is no doubt that under\n",
      "her last two kings the city's influence was re-established, and that\n",
      "she exercised control over Babylon itself. In the course of the German\n",
      "excavations, a clay cone has been found in the temple E-patutila at\n",
      "Babylon, bearing a votive inscription of Sin-magir, the fifteenth king\n",
      "of Isin; and this was evidently dedicated by him as a votive offering\n",
      "in his character of suzerain of the city.[46] Moreover, in this text he\n",
      "lays claim to the rule of Sumer and Akkad. Akkad, as well as Sumer, was\n",
      "also held by his son Damik-ilishu, who succeeded him upon the throne.\n",
      "For a tablet has been found at AbÃ» Habba, dated in the year in which\n",
      "Damik-ilishu built the wall of Isin,[47] and the date upon a tablet\n",
      "from Nippur commemorates his building of the temple of Shamash, named\n",
      "E-ditar-kalama, which was probably in Babylon.[48] Thus both Sippar and\n",
      "Babylon were subject to the city of Isin under the last of her rulers,\n",

      "Foreign invasions might result in the fall of dynasties, and her kings\n",

      "immigration which resulted in the establishment of her First Dynasty,\n",
      "the racial character of Babylonia became dominantly Semitic. Before\n",

      "\n",
      "In the preceding pages we have followed the history of the Sumerian\n",
      "race from the period of its earliest settlement in Babylonia until\n",
      "the time when its political power was drawing to a close. The gradual\n",
      "growth of the state has been described, from the first rude settlements\n",
      "around a series of ancient cult-centres, through the phase of highly\n",
      "developed but still independent city-states, to a united kingdom of\n",
      "Sumer and Akkad, based on ideals inherited from the Semitic North. We\n",
      "have traced the inter-relations of North and South, of Sumerians and\n",
      "Semites, and have watched their varying fortunes in the racial conflict\n",
      "which bulks so largely in the history of the two countries. Points have\n",
      "also been noted at which contact with other lands can be historically\n",
      "proved, and it has thus been found possible to estimate the limits of\n",
      "the kingdoms which were established in Sumer or Akkad during the later\n",
      "periods. Of foreign lands which came into direct relationship with\n",
      "Babylonia, Elam plays by far the most conspicuous part. In the time of\n",
      "the city-states she invades the land of Sumer, and later on is in her\n",
      "turn conquered by Akkadian and Sumerian kings. The question naturally\n",
      "arises, how far this close political contact affected the cultural\n",
      "development of the two countries, and suggests the further query as to\n",
      "what extent their civilizations were of common origin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another region which figures in the list of conquered countries is\n",
      "Amurru, or the \"Western Land,\" and an attempt must be made to trace\n",
      "the paths of Babylonian influence beyond the limits of Syria, and to\n",
      "ascertain its effects within the area of Aegean culture. The later\n",
      "trade routes were doubtless already in existence, and archaeological\n",
      "research can often detect evidence of cultural connection, at a\n",
      "time when there is no question of any political contact. Moreover,\n",
      "in spite of the absence of Neolithic settlements in Babylonia, and\n",
      "the comparatively advanced state of culture which characterizes the\n",
      "earliest of Sumerian sites, it is possible that contact with other and\n",
      "distant races had already taken place in prehistoric times. One of the\n",
      "most fascinating problems connected with the early history of Sumer\n",
      "concerns the relationship which her culture bore to that of Egypt. On\n",
      "this point recent excavations have thrown considerable light; and, as\n",
      "the suggested connection, whether direct or indirect, must admittedly\n",
      "have taken place in a remote age, it will be well to attack this\n",
      "problem before discussing the relationship of Sumer to the other great\n",
      "centres of ancient civilization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although no direct contact between Babylonia and Egypt has been\n",
      "proved during the earlier historical periods, the opinion has been\n",
      "very generally held that the Egyptian civilization was largely\n",
      "influenced in its first stages by that of Babylonia. The use of the\n",
      "stone cylinder-seal by the Egyptians certainly furnished a very cogent\n",
      "argument in favour of the view that some early cultural connection\n",
      "must have taken place; and, as the cylinder-seal was peculiarly\n",
      "characteristic of Babylonia during all periods, whereas its use was\n",
      "gradually discontinued in Egypt, the inference seemed obvious that it\n",
      "was an original product of Babylonia, whence it had reached Egypt in\n",
      "late predynastic or early dynastic times. This view appeared to find\n",
      "support in other points of resemblance which were noted between the\n",
      "early art and culture of the two countries. Mace-heads of bulbous or\n",
      "\"egg-shaped\" form were employed by the early inhabitants of both lands.\n",
      "The Egyptian slate carvings of the First Dynasty were compared with the\n",
      "early bas-reliefs and engraved seals of the Sumerians, and resemblances\n",
      "were pointed out both in subject-matter and in the symmetrical\n",
      "arrangement of the designs. The employment of brick, in place of\n",
      "stone, as a building material, was regarded as due to Babylonian\n",
      "influence; and the crenelated walls of Early Egyptian buildings, the\n",
      "existence of which was proved not only by pictured representations on\n",
      "the slate carvings, but also by the remains of actual buildings such\n",
      "as the mastaba-tomb of King Aha at NakÃ¢da, and the ancient fortress of\n",
      "Abydos, known as the Shunet ez-ZebÃ®b, were treated as borrowed from\n",
      "Sumerian originals. That irrigation was practised on the banks of the\n",
      "Nile as well as in the Euphrates valley, and that wheat was grown in\n",
      "both countries, were cited as additional proofs that Babylonia must\n",
      "have exercised a marked influence on Egyptian culture during the early\n",
      "stages of its development.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to explain such resemblances between the early cultures of\n",
      "Sumer and Egypt, it was necessary to seek some channel by which the\n",
      "influence of the former country could have reached the valley of the\n",
      "Nile; and a solution of the problem was found in the theory of a\n",
      "Semitic invasion of Upper Egypt towards the end of the predynastic\n",
      "period. That a Semitic element existed in the composition of the\n",
      "ancient Egyptian language is established beyond dispute; and this\n",
      "fact was combined with the Egyptian legends of their origin on the\n",
      "Red Sea coast, and with the situation of the predynastic and early\n",
      "dynastic cemeteries in Upper Egypt, in support of the theory that\n",
      "Semitic tribes, already imbued with Sumerian culture, had reached\n",
      "the Nile from the shore of the Red Sea by way of the WÃ¢di HammamÃ¢t.\n",
      "According to this view the Neolithic and predynastic population of\n",
      "Egypt was of a different race to the early dynastic Egyptians. The\n",
      "former were regarded as indigenous to the country, speaking a language\n",
      "possibly akin to the Berber dialects of North Africa. With little or\n",
      "no knowledge of metal, they were pictured as offering a stubborn but\n",
      "unsuccessful resistance to their Semitic conquerors. The latter were\n",
      "assumed to have brought with them a copper age culture, ultimately\n",
      "derived from the Sumerians of Babylonia. Crossing from southern Arabia\n",
      "by the Straits of Bab el-Mandeb, and making their way northward along\n",
      "the western shore of the Red Sea, they would have reached the Nile in\n",
      "the neighbourhood of Koptos. Here they would have formed their first\n",
      "settlements, and, after subduing the older inhabitants of Upper Egypt,\n",
      "they would have pushed their way northwards along the valley of the\n",
      "Nile.[1]\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no doubt that the union of Upper and Lower Egypt into a single\n",
      "monarchy, traditionally ascribed to Mena, the legendary founder of the\n",
      "first Egyptian dynasty, did result from a conquest of the North by the\n",
      "South. Mena himself was regarded as sprung from a line of local rulers\n",
      "established at This, or Thinis, in the neighbourhood of Abydos, and\n",
      "also as the founder of Memphis at the head of the Delta, whither he\n",
      "transferred his throne. Further traces of the conquest of the North by\n",
      "the South have been preserved in the legends concerning the followers\n",
      "of Horus, the patron deity of the first kings of Upper Egypt. The\n",
      "advance of the Sky-god of Edfu with his Mesniu or \"Smiths,\"[2] who are\n",
      "related to have won battle after battle as they pressed northwards,\n",
      "is amply confirmed by the early dynastic monuments that have been\n",
      "recovered by excavation. The slate carving of Narmer, on which is\n",
      "portrayed the victory of Horus over the kingdom of the Harpoon near the\n",
      "Canopic branch of the Nile, may well represent one of the last decisive\n",
      "victories of the Horus-worshippers, as they extended their authority\n",
      "northwards to the sea.[3] Of the historical character of this conquest\n",
      "of Lower Egypt by the kings of the South, which resulted in the\n",
      "union of the whole country under a single monarchy, there are now no\n",
      "two opinions. The point, about which some uncertainty still exists,\n",
      "concerns the racial character of the conquerors and the origin of their\n",
      "higher culture, by virtue of which their victories were obtained.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the hypothesis of a Semitic invasion, the higher elements in\n",
      "the early culture of Egypt are, as we have seen, to be traced to\n",
      "a non-Egyptian source. The Semitic immigrants are assumed to have\n",
      "introduced, not only the use of metal, but also a knowledge of letters.\n",
      "The Sumerian system of writing has been regarded as the parent of\n",
      "the Egyptian hieroglyphic characters; and comparisons have been made\n",
      "between the names of Sumerian and Egyptian gods.[4] The suggestion has\n",
      "also been put forward that the fashion of extended burial, which in\n",
      "Egypt gradually displaced the contracted position of the corpse, was\n",
      "also to be traced to Babylonian influence.\n",
      "\n",
      "It must be admitted that, until quite recently, this view furnished\n",
      "a very plausible explanation of the various points of resemblance\n",
      "noted between the civilizations of the two countries. Moreover, the\n",
      "evidence obtained by excavation on early sites certainly appeared\n",
      "to show a distinct break between the predynastic and early dynastic\n",
      "cultures of Egypt. To account for what seemed so sudden a change in the\n",
      "character of Egyptian civilization, the theory of a foreign invasion\n",
      "seemed almost inevitable. But the publication of the results of Dr.\n",
      "Reisner's excavations at Naga-ed-DÃªr and other early cemeteries in\n",
      "Upper Egypt,[5] has rendered it necessary to revise the theory; while\n",
      "the still more recent diggings of M. Naville at Abydos prove that the\n",
      "changes, in certain districts, were even more gradual than had been\n",
      "supposed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Put briefly, Dr. Reisner's conclusion is that there was no sudden\n",
      "break of continuity between the Neolithic and early dynastic cultures\n",
      "of Egypt. His extensive and laborious comparison of the predynastic\n",
      "burials with those of the First and Second Dynasties, has shown that\n",
      "no essential change took place in the Egyptian conception of the life\n",
      "after death, or in the rites and practices which accompanied the\n",
      "interment of the body. In early dynastic as in Neolithic times the body\n",
      "of the dead man was placed in a contracted position on its left side\n",
      "and with the head to the south, and the grave was still furnished with\n",
      "food, arms, tools, and ornaments. Moreover, the changes observable\n",
      "in the construction of the grave itself, and in the character of\n",
      "the objects within it, were not due to the sudden influence of any\n",
      "alien race, but may well have been the result of a gradual process of\n",
      "improvement in the technical skill of the Egyptians themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "The three most striking points of difference beween the products of\n",
      "the predynastic and dynastic periods centre round the character of\n",
      "the pottery and vessels for household use, the material employed for\n",
      "tools and weapons, and the invention of writing. It would now appear\n",
      "that the various changes were all gradually introduced, and one period\n",
      "fades into another without any strongly marked line of division between\n",
      "them. A knowledge of copper has always been credited to the later\n",
      "predynastic Egyptians, and it is now possible to trace the gradual\n",
      "steps by which the invention of a practical method of working it was\n",
      "attained. Copper ornaments and objects found in graves earlier than the\n",
      "middle predynastic period are small and of little practical utility, as\n",
      "compared with the beautifully flaked flint knives, daggers, and lances,\n",
      "which still retained the importance they enjoyed in purely Neolithic\n",
      "times. At a rather later stage in the predynastic period copper\n",
      "dagger-blades and adzes were produced in imitation of flint and stone\n",
      "forms, and these mark the transition to the heavy weapons and tools\n",
      "of copper, which in the early dynastic period largely ousted flint and\n",
      "stone implements for practical use.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gradual attainment of skill in the working of copper ore on the\n",
      "part of the early Egyptians had a marked effect on the whole status\n",
      "of their culture. Their improved weapons enabled them by conquest\n",
      "to draw their raw materials from a far more extended area; and the\n",
      "adaptation of copper tools for quarrying blocks of stone undoubtedly\n",
      "led to its increased employment as a stronger and more permanent\n",
      "substitute for clay. The use of the copper chisel also explains the\n",
      "elaborate carvings upon the early dynastic slates, and the invention\n",
      "of the stone borer brought about the gradual displacement of pottery\n",
      "in favour of stone vessels for household purposes. Thus, while\n",
      "metal-casting and stone-working improved, they did so at the expense\n",
      "of the older arts of flint-knapping and the manufacture of pottery\n",
      "by hand, both of which tended to degenerate and die out. Dr. Reisner\n",
      "had already inferred that for ceremonial purposes, as distinct from\n",
      "the needs of everyday life, both flint implements and certain earlier\n",
      "types of pottery continued to be employed. And M. Naville's diggings at\n",
      "Abydos, during the season of 1909-10, seem to prove that the process\n",
      "was even slower and less uniform than had been thought possible. In\n",
      "fact, according to the excavators, it would appear that in certain\n",
      "districts in Egypt a modified form of the predynastic culture, using\n",
      "the characteristic red and black pottery, survived as late as the Sixth\n",
      "Dynasty; while it is known that in Nubia a type of pottery, closely\n",
      "akin to the same prehistoric ware, continued in use as late as the\n",
      "Eighteenth Dynasty.[6] However such survivals are to be explained, the\n",
      "beginning of the dynastic period in Egypt does not appear to present\n",
      "a break in either racial or cultural continuity. Indeed, a precisely\n",
      "parallel development may be traced between the early dynastic period,\n",
      "and that represented by the Third and Fourth Dynasties, when there\n",
      "is no question of any such break. As the stone vessels of the first\n",
      "two dynasties had proved themselves superior to hand-made pottery\n",
      "for practical purposes, so they in turn were displaced by wheel-made\n",
      "pottery.[7] These changes may be traced to gradual improvements in\n",
      "manufacture; arts such as mat-weaving and bead-making, which were\n",
      "unaffected by the new inventions, continued to be practised without\n",
      "change in the early dynastic as in the predynastic periods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent archaeological research thus leaves small room for the theory\n",
      "that Egyptian culture was subjected to any strong foreign influence in\n",
      "early dynastic times, and its conclusions on this point are confirmed\n",
      "by anatomical evidence. The systematic measurement and comparison\n",
      "of skulls from predynastic and dynastic burials, which have been\n",
      "conducted by Dr. Elliot Smith of the Khedivial School of Medicine in\n",
      "collaboration with the Hearst Expedition, has demonstrated the lineal\n",
      "descent of the dynastic from the predynastic Egyptians. The two groups\n",
      "to all intents and purposes represent the same people, and in the\n",
      "later period there is no trace of any new racial element, or of the\n",
      "admixture of any foreign strain. Thus the theory of an invasion of\n",
      "Egypt by Semitic tribes towards the close of the predynastic period\n",
      "must be given up, and, although this does not in itself negative the\n",
      "possibility of Sumerian influence having reached Egypt through channels\n",
      "of commercial intercourse, it necessitates a more careful scrutiny of\n",
      "the different points of resemblance between the cultures of the two\n",
      "countries on which the original theory was founded.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the subjects on which the extreme upholders of the theory have\n",
      "insisted concerns the invention of the Egyptian system of writing,\n",
      "which is alleged by them to have been borrowed from Babylonia. But\n",
      "it must be noted that those signs which correspond to one another\n",
      "in the two systems are such as would naturally be identical in any\n",
      "two systems of pictorial writing, developed independently but under\n",
      "similar conditions. The sun all the world over would be represented\n",
      "by a circle, a mountain by a rough outline of a mountain peak, an ox\n",
      "by a horned head, and so on. To prove any connection between the\n",
      "two systems a resemblance should be established between the more\n",
      "conventionalized signs, and here the comparison breaks down completely.\n",
      "It should further be noted that the Egyptian system has reached us in a\n",
      "far more primitive state than that of Babylonia. While the hieroglyphic\n",
      "signs are actual pictures of the objects represented, even the earliest\n",
      "line-characters of Sumer are so conventionalized that their original\n",
      "form would scarcely have been recognized, had not their meaning been\n",
      "already known. In fact, no example of Sumerian writing has yet been\n",
      "recovered which could have furnished a pattern for the Egyptian scribe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the appearance of writing in Egypt was not so sudden an\n",
      "event as it is often represented. The buff-coloured pottery of\n",
      "predynastic times, with its red line decoration, proves that the\n",
      "Eygptian had a natural faculty for drawing men, animals, plants, boats\n",
      "and conventional designs. In these picture-drawings of the predynastic\n",
      "period we may see the basis of the hieroglyphic system of writing,\n",
      "for in them the use of symbolism is already developed. The employment\n",
      "of fetish emblems, or symbols, to represent the different gods,[8] is\n",
      "in itself a rough form of ideographic expression, and, if developed\n",
      "along its own lines, would naturally lead to the invention of a regular\n",
      "ideographic form of writing. There is little doubt that this process is\n",
      "what actually took place. The first impetus may have been given by the\n",
      "necessity for marks of private ownership, and by the need for conveying\n",
      "authority from the chief to his subordinates at a distance. Symbols for\n",
      "the names of rulers and of places would thus soon be added to those\n",
      "for the gods, and when a need was felt to commemorate some victory or\n",
      "great achievement of the king, such symbols would naturally be used in\n",
      "combination. This process may be traced on the earlier monuments of the\n",
      "First Dynasty, the records on which are still practically ideographic\n",
      "in character. A very similar process doubtless led to the invention of\n",
      "the cuneiform system, and there is no need to assume that either Egypt\n",
      "or Babylonia was indebted to the other country for her knowledge of\n",
      "writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "We obtain a very similar result in the case of other points of\n",
      "resemblance which have been cited to prove a close connection between\n",
      "the early cultures of the two countries. Considerable stress has been\n",
      "laid on a certain similarity, which the Egyptian slate carvings of\n",
      "the dynastic period bear to examples of early Sumerian sculpture and\n",
      "engraving. It is true that composite creatures are characteristic of\n",
      "the art of both countries, and that their arrangement on the stone\n",
      "is often \"heraldic\" and symmetrical. But the human-headed bull, the\n",
      "favourite monster of Sumerian art, is never found upon the Egyptian\n",
      "monuments, on which not only the natural beasts but also the composite\n",
      "creatures are invariably of an Egyptian or African character. The\n",
      "general resemblance in style has also been exaggerated. To take a\n",
      "single instance, a comparison has frequently been made between the\n",
      "Stele of the Vultures and the broken slate carving in the British\n",
      "Museum, No. 20791.[9] On the former vultures are depicted carrying off\n",
      "the limbs of the slain, and on the latter captives are represented as\n",
      "cast out into the desert to be devoured by birds and beasts of prey.\n",
      "But the style of the two monuments is very different, and the Egyptian\n",
      "is far more varied in character. In addition to a single vulture, we\n",
      "see a number of ravens, a hawk, an eagle, and a lion, all attracted by\n",
      "the dead; and the arrangement of the composition and the technique\n",
      "itself are quite unlike Sumerian work. There is also no need to trace\n",
      "the symmetrical arrangement of other of the Egyptian compositions to\n",
      "Babylonian influence, for, given an oval plaque to decorate while\n",
      "leaving a circular space in the centre, a symmetrical arrangement would\n",
      "naturally arise.[10]\n",
      "\n",
      "Another Egyptian characteristic, also ascribed to Babylonian influence,\n",
      "is the custom of extended burial with mummification, which only begins\n",
      "to be met with during the Third and Fourth Dynasties. Since the dead\n",
      "are portrayed on the Stele of the Vultures as arranged in the extended\n",
      "position beneath the burial-mound,[11] it was formerly assumed that\n",
      "this was the regular Sumerian practice; and the contracted forms of\n",
      "burial, which had been found at Warka, Mukayyar, Surghul, Niffer and\n",
      "other Babylonian sites, were usually assigned to very late periods.\n",
      "The excavations at FÃ¢ra and AbÃ» Hatab have corrected this assumption,\n",
      "and have proved that the Sumerian corpse was regularly arranged for\n",
      "burial in the contracted position, lying on its side.[12] The apparent\n",
      "exception to this rule upon the Stele of the Vultures may probably be\n",
      "regarded as characteristic only of burial upon the field of battle.\n",
      "There it must often have been impossible to furnish each corpse with\n",
      "a grave to itself, or to procure the regular offerings and furniture\n",
      "which accompanied individual interment. The bodies were therefore\n",
      "arranged side by side in a common grave, and covered with a tumulus\n",
      "of earth to ensure their entrance into the under world. But this\n",
      "was clearly a makeshift form of burial, necessitated by exceptional\n",
      "circumstances, and was not the regular Sumerian practice of the\n",
      "period.[13] Whatever may have given rise to the Egyptian change in\n",
      "burial customs, the cause is not to be sought in Babylonian influence.\n",
      "\n",
      "A further point, which has been cleared up by recent excavation on\n",
      "early Babylonian sites, concerns the crenelated form of building,\n",
      "which was formerly regarded as peculiarly characteristic of Sumerian\n",
      "architecture of the early period and as having influenced that of\n",
      "Egypt. It is now known that this form of external decoration is\n",
      "not met with in Babylonia before the period of Gudea and the kings\n",
      "of Ur. Thus, if any borrowing took place, it must have been on the\n",
      "Babylonian side. The employment of brick as a building material may\n",
      "also have been evolved in Egypt without any prompting from Babylonia,\n",
      "for the forms of brick employed are quite distinct in both countries.\n",
      "The peculiar plano-convex brick, which is characteristic of early\n",
      "Sumerian buildings, is never found in Egypt, where the rectangular\n",
      "oblong form was employed from the earliest period.[14] Thus many\n",
      "points of resemblance, which were formerly regarded as indicating a\n",
      "close cultural connection between the two countries, now appear to\n",
      "be far less striking than was formerly the case.[15] Others, again,\n",
      "may be explained as due to Egyptian influence on Babylonian culture\n",
      "rather than as the result of the reverse process. For example, the\n",
      "resemblance that has been pointed out between Gudea's sculpture in the\n",
      "round and that of the Fourth Dynasty in Egypt may not be fortuitous.\n",
      "For Gudea maintained close commercial relations with the Syrian coast,\n",
      "where Egyptian influence at that time had long been effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "There remains to be considered the use of the bulbous mace-head and of\n",
      "the stone cylindrical seal, both of which are striking characteristics\n",
      "of the early Egyptian and Sumerian cultures. It is difficult to regard\n",
      "these classes of objects, and particularly the latter, as having been\n",
      "evolved independently in Egypt and by the Sumerians. In Babylonia the\n",
      "cylinder-seal is already highly developed when found on the earliest\n",
      "Sumerian sites, and it would appear that the Sumerian immigrants\n",
      "brought it with them into the country, along with their system of\n",
      "writing and the other elements of their comparatively advanced state\n",
      "of civilization. Whether they themselves had evolved it in their\n",
      "original home, or had obtained it from some other race with whom they\n",
      "came into contact before reaching the valley of the Euphrates, it is\n",
      "still impossible to say. The evidence from Susa has not yet thrown much\n",
      "light upon this point. While some stone seals and clay sealings have\n",
      "been found in the lowest stratum of the mound, they are not cylindrical\n",
      "but in the form of flat stamps. The cylindrical seal appears, however,\n",
      "to have been introduced at Susa at a comparatively early period,\n",
      "for examples are said to have been found in the group of strata\n",
      "representing the \"Second Period,\" at a depth of from fifteen to twenty\n",
      "metres below the surface. The published material does not yet admit\n",
      "of any certain pronouncement with regard to the earliest history of\n",
      "the cylinder-seal and its migrations. In favour of the view that would\n",
      "regard it as an independent product of the early Egyptians, it may be\n",
      "noted that wood and not stone was the commonest material for cylinders\n",
      "in the earliest period.[16] But if the predynastic cylinder of Egypt\n",
      "is to be regarded as ultimately derived from Asia, the connection is to\n",
      "be set at a period anterior to the earliest Sumerian settlements that\n",
      "have yet been identified.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus the results of recent excavation and research, both in Egypt\n",
      "and Babylonia, have tended to diminish rather than to increase the\n",
      "evidence of any close connection between the early cultures of the two\n",
      "countries. Apart from any Babylonian influence, there is, however,\n",
      "ample proof of a Semitic element, not only in the language, but also in\n",
      "the religion of ancient Egypt. The Egyptian sun-worship, which forms\n",
      "so striking a contrast to the indigenous animal-cults and worship of\n",
      "the dead, was probably of Semitic origin, and may either have reached\n",
      "Upper Egypt from Southern Arabia,[17] or have entered Lower Egypt by\n",
      "the eastern Delta. The latter region has always formed an open door to\n",
      "Egypt, and the invasion of the Hyksos may well have had its prototype\n",
      "in predynastic times. The enemies, whose conquest is commemorated on\n",
      "several of the early dynastic slate-carvings, are of non-Egyptian type;\n",
      "they may possibly have been descendants of such Semitic immigrants,\n",
      "unless they were Libyan settlers from the west. In the historic period\n",
      "we have evidence of direct contact between Syria and Egypt at the time\n",
      "of the Third Dynasty, for the Palermo Stele records the arrival in\n",
      "Egypt of forty ships laden with cedar-wood in Sneferu's reign. These\n",
      "evidently formed an expedition sent by sea to the Lebanon, and we may\n",
      "assume that Sneferu's predecessors had already extended their influence\n",
      "along the Syrian coast.[18] It is in Syria that we may also set the\n",
      "first contact between the civilizations of Egypt and Babylonia in\n",
      "historic times. The early Sumerian ruler Lugal-zaggisi boasts that he\n",
      "reached the Mediterranean coast, and his expedition merely formed the\n",
      "prelude to the conquest of Syria by Shar-Gani-sharri of Akkad.[19]\n",
      "It has indeed been suggested that evidence of Egyptian influence,\n",
      "following on the latter's Syrian campaign, is to be seen in the\n",
      "deification of early Babylonian kings.[20] And although this practice\n",
      "may now be traced with greater probability to a Sumerian source,[21]\n",
      "there can be little doubt that from Shar-Gani-sharri's reign onwards\n",
      "Syria formed a connecting-link between the two great civilizations on\n",
      "the Euphrates and the Nile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Far closer than her relations with Egypt were the ties which connected\n",
      "Babylonia with the great centre of civilization which lay upon\n",
      "her eastern frontier. In the course of this history reference has\n",
      "frequently been made to the contact which was continually taking place\n",
      "from the earliest historical period between Elam and the Sumerian and\n",
      "Semitic rulers of Sumer and Akkad. Such political relationships were\n",
      "naturally accompanied by close commercial intercourse, and the effects\n",
      "of Sumerian influence upon the native culture of Elam have been fully\n",
      "illustrated by the excavations conducted at Susa by the \"DÃ©lÃ©gation en\n",
      "Perse.\"[22] Situated on the river Kerkha, Susa occupied an important\n",
      "strategic position at the head of the caravan routes which connected\n",
      "the Iranian plateau with the lower valley of the Tigris and Euphrates\n",
      "and the shores of the Persian Gulf. The river washed the foot of the\n",
      "low hills on which the town was built, and formed a natural defence\n",
      "against attack from the west. The situation of the city on the left\n",
      "bank of the stream is an indication that even in the earliest period\n",
      "its founders sought to protect themselves from the danger of sudden\n",
      "raids from the direction of Sumer and Akkad. The earliest Sumerian\n",
      "records also reflect the feelings of hostility to Elam which animated\n",
      "their writers. But from these scattered references it would appear\n",
      "that the Elamites at this time were generally the aggressors, and\n",
      "that they succeeded in keeping their country free from any political\n",
      "interference on the part of the more powerful among the Sumerian\n",
      "city-states. It was not until the period of Semitic expansion, under\n",
      "the later kingdom of Kish and the empire of Akkad, that the country\n",
      "became dominated by Babylonian influence.\n",
      "\n",
      "We could not have more striking evidence of the extent to which Elam\n",
      "at this time became subject to Semitic culture than in the adoption\n",
      "of the Babylonian character and language by the native rulers of the\n",
      "country. We are met with the strange picture of native patesis of Susa\n",
      "and governors of Elam recording their votive offerings in a foreign\n",
      "script and language, and making invocations to purely Babylonian\n",
      "deities.[23] The Babylonian script was also adopted for writing\n",
      "inscriptions in the native Elamite tongue, and had we no other evidence\n",
      "available, it might be urged that the use of the Semitic language for\n",
      "the votive texts was dictated by purely temporary considerations of\n",
      "a political character. There is no doubt, however, that the Semitic\n",
      "conquest of Elam was accompanied, and probably preceded, by extensive\n",
      "Semitic immigration. Even at the time of the Dynasty of Ur, when Elam\n",
      "was subject to direct Sumerian control, the Semitic influence of\n",
      "Akkad had become too firmly rooted to be displaced, and it received a\n",
      "fresh impetus under the later rulers of the First Dynasty of Babylon.\n",
      "The clay tablets of a commercial and agricultural character, dating\n",
      "from the period of Adda-Pakshu,[24] are written in the Babylonian\n",
      "character and language,[25] like those found at Mal-AmÃ®r to the east of\n",
      "Susa.[26] The latter do not date from a period earlier than about 1000\n",
      "B.C., and they throw an interesting light on the permanent character\n",
      "of Babylonian influence in the country. The modified forms of the\n",
      "Babylonian characters, which were employed by the Achaemenian kings\n",
      "for the Elamite column of their trilingual inscriptions, are to be\n",
      "traced to a comparatively late origin. The development of the writing\n",
      "exhibited by the Neo-Anzanite texts may be connected with the national\n",
      "revival which characterized the later Elamite monarchy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The evidence furnished by the inscriptions found at Susa and other\n",
      "sites in Elam is supported by the archaeological discoveries in\n",
      "proving that, from the time of the Semitic kings of Kish and Akkad,\n",
      "the cultural development of Elam was to a great extent moulded by\n",
      "Babylonia. But the later products of native Elamite workmanship that\n",
      "have been recovered are no slavish copies of Babylonian originals, and\n",
      "the earlier examples of sculpture and engraving are of a character\n",
      "quite distinct from anything found on Babylonian soil.[27] Moreover, in\n",
      "the casting of metal and in the jewellers' art Elam certainly in time\n",
      "excelled her neighbour,[28] and, even in the later periods, her art\n",
      "presents itself as of vigorous growth, influenced it is true by that of\n",
      "Babylonia, but deriving its impetus and inspiration from purely native\n",
      "sources. It is also significant that the earlier the remains that have\n",
      "been recovered the less do they betray any trace of foreign influence.\n",
      "\n",
      "A very striking proof of the independent development of Elamite culture\n",
      "prior to the Semitic conquest is now furnished by the texts inscribed\n",
      "in the so-called \"proto-Elamite\" system of writing.[29] The majority\n",
      "consist of small roughly-formed tablets of clay, and the signs upon\n",
      "them are either figures or ideographs for various objects. Though they\n",
      "have not been fully deciphered, it is clear that they are tablets of\n",
      "accounts and inventories. A very few of the signs, such as those for\n",
      "\"tablet\" and \"total,\" resemble the corresponding Babylonian characters,\n",
      "but the great majority are entirely different and have been evolved on\n",
      "a system of their own. Lapidary forms of the characters have been found\n",
      "in inscriptions accompanying Semitic texts of Basha-Shushinak;[30] and,\n",
      "from the position of each upon the stone, it was inferred that the\n",
      "Semitic text was engraved first and the proto-Elamite section added to\n",
      "it. That they were contemporary additions seemed probable, and this\n",
      "has now been put beyond a doubt by the discovery at Susa of a stone\n",
      "statuette seated upon a throne, which was dedicated to a goddess by\n",
      "Basha-Shushinak.[31] On the front of the throne at each side of the\n",
      "seated figure is an inscription; that on the left side is in Semitic,\n",
      "and that on the right in proto-Elamite characters. The one is obviously\n",
      "a translation of the other, and their symmetrical arrangement leaves no\n",
      "doubt that they were inscribed at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is therefore clear that at the time of Basha-Shushinak the two\n",
      "languages and scripts were sometimes employed side by side for votive\n",
      "inscriptions, while the clay tablets prove that the native script\n",
      "had not yet been superseded for the purposes of everyday life. The\n",
      "\"proto-Elamite\" characters present very few parallelisms to Babylonian\n",
      "signs, and those that do occur are clearly later accretions. Thus it\n",
      "would be natural enough to borrow the Babylonian sign for \"tablet,\" at\n",
      "a time when the clay tablet itself found its way across the border;\n",
      "and, though the signs for \"total\" correspond, the Elamite figures\n",
      "differ and are based on a decimal, not on a sexigesimal system of\n",
      "numeration. It may therefore be inferred that the writing had no\n",
      "connection in its origin with that of the Sumerians, and was invented\n",
      "independently of the system employed during the earliest periods in\n",
      "Babylonia. It may have been merely a local form of writing and not\n",
      "in general use throughout the whole of Elam, but its existence makes\n",
      "it probable that the district in which Susa was situated was not\n",
      "subject to any strong influence from Babylonia in the age preceding\n",
      "the Semitic expansion. This inference is strengthened by a study of\n",
      "the seal-impressions upon many of the tablets;[32] the designs consist\n",
      "of figured representations of animals and composite monsters, and\n",
      "their treatment is totally different to that found on early Sumerian\n",
      "cylinders. In the total disappearance of its local script Cappadocia\n",
      "offers an interesting parallel to Elam. The Hittite hieroglyphs were\n",
      "obviously of purely native origin, but they did not survive the\n",
      "introduction of the clay tablet and of cuneiform characters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The earlier strata of the mounds at Susa, which date from the\n",
      "prehistoric periods in the city's history, have proved to be in some\n",
      "confusion as revealed by the French excavations; but an explanation has\n",
      "recently been forthcoming of many of the discrepancies in level that\n",
      "have previously been noted.[33] It would seem that the northern and\n",
      "southern extremities of the Citadel Tell were the most ancient sites of\n",
      "habitation, and that from this cause two small hills were formed which\n",
      "persisted during the earlier periods of the city's history. In course\n",
      "of time the ground between them was occupied and was gradually filled\n",
      "in so that the earlier contour of the mound was lost. It thus happens\n",
      "that while remains of the Kassite period are found in the centre of the\n",
      "tell at a depth of from fifteen to twenty metres, they occur at the two\n",
      "extremities in strata not more than ten metres below the surface. Even\n",
      "so, the later of the two prehistoric strata at the extremities of the\n",
      "mound, representing an epoch anterior to that of the \"proto-Elamite\"\n",
      "inscriptions, contains only scattered objects, and it is still\n",
      "difficult to trace the gradual evolution of culture which took place in\n",
      "this and in the still earlier period. It should also be noted that the\n",
      "presence of a single stratum, enclosing remains of a purely Neolithic\n",
      "period, has not yet been established at Susa. There is little doubt,\n",
      "however, that such a stratum at one time existed, for stone axes,\n",
      "arrow-heads, knives and scrapers, representing a period of Neolithic\n",
      "culture, are found scattered at every level in the mound. It is thus\n",
      "possible that, in spite of the presence of metal in the same stratum,\n",
      "much of the earlier remains discovered at Susa, and particularly the\n",
      "earlier forms of painted pottery,[34] are to be assigned to a Neolithic\n",
      "settlement upon the site.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately for the study of the early ceramics of Elam, we have not\n",
      "to depend solely on the rather inconclusive data which the excavations\n",

      "group of mounds, situated about ninety-three miles to the west of Susa,\n",
      "which form a striking feature on the caravan route to Kermanshah. The\n",
      "central and most important of the mounds is known as the Tepe Mussian,\n",
      "and its name is often employed as a general designation for the group.\n",
      "The excavations conducted there in the winter of 1902-3 have brought\n",
      "to light a series of painted wares, ranging in date from a purely\n",
      "Neolithic period to an age in which metal was already beginning to\n",
      "appear.[35] This wealth of material is valuable for comparison with\n",
      "the very similar pottery from Susa, and has furnished additional data\n",
      "for determining the cultural connections of the earlier inhabitants of\n",
      "the country. The designs upon the finer classes of painted ware, both\n",
      "at Susa and Mussian, are not only geometric in character, but include\n",
      "vegetable and animal forms. Some of the latter have been held to bear\n",
      "a certain likeness to designs which occur upon the later pottery of\n",
      "the predynastic age in Egypt, and it is mainly on the strength of\n",
      "such points of resemblance that M. de Morgan would trace a connection\n",
      "between the early cultures of the two countries.[36]\n",
      "\n",
      "But quite apart from objections based on the great difference of\n",
      "technique, the absence of any pottery similar to the Egyptian in\n",
      "Babylonia and Northern Syria renders it difficult to accept the\n",
      "suggestion; and it is in other quarters that we may possibly recognize\n",
      "traces of a similar culture to that of the earlier age in Elam. The\n",
      "resemblance between the more geometric designs upon the Elamite pottery\n",
      "and that discovered at Kara-Uyuk in Cappadocia has been pointed out by\n",
      "Professor Sayce;[37] and Mr. Hall has recently compared them in detail\n",
      "with very similar potsherds discovered by the Pumpelly Expedition\n",
      "at Anau in Russian Turkestan,[38] and by Professor Garstang[39] at\n",
      "Sakjegeuzi in Syria.[40] It should be noted that, so far as Elam is\n",
      "concerned, the resemblance applies only to one class of the designs\n",
      "upon the early painted pottery, and does not include the animal and\n",
      "a majority of the vegetable motives. It is sufficiently striking,\n",
      "however, to point the direction in which we may look for further light\n",
      "upon the problem. Future excavations at Susa itself and on sites in\n",
      "Asia Minor will doubtless show how far we may press the suggested\n",
      "theory of an early cultural connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "While such suggestions are still in a nebulous state, it would be\n",
      "rash to dogmatize on the relation of these prehistoric peoples to\n",
      "the Elamites of history. A study of the designs upon the Elamite\n",
      "potsherds makes it clear, however, that there was no sudden break\n",
      "between the cultures of the two periods. For many of the animal\n",
      "motives of a more conventionalized character are obviously derived\n",
      "from the peculiarly Elamite forms of composite monsters, which are\n",
      "reproduced in the seal-impressions upon \"proto-Elamite\" tablets.[41]\n",
      "Moreover, it is stated that among the decorative motives on pot-sherds\n",
      "recently discovered in the lowest stratum at Susa are a number of\n",
      "representations of a purely religious character.[42] It is possible\n",
      "that these will prove to be the ancestors of some of the sacred emblems\n",
      "which, after being developed on Elamite soil, reached Babylonia\n",
      "during the Kassite period.[43] How far Babylonia participated in the\n",
      "prehistoric culture of Elam it is difficult to say, since no Neolithic\n",
      "settlement has yet been identified in Sumer or Akkad. Moreover, the\n",
      "early Sumerian pottery discovered at Tello, which dates from an age\n",
      "when a knowledge of metal was already well advanced, does not appear\n",
      "to have resembled the prehistoric wares of Elam, either in composition\n",
      "or in design. It should be noted, however, that terra-cotta female\n",
      "figurines, of the well-known Babylonian type, occur in Elam and at\n",
      "Anau[44]; and it is possible that in Babylonia they were relics of a\n",
      "prehistoric culture. On sites in the alluvial portion of the country\n",
      "it is probable that few Neolithic remains have been preserved.[45]\n",
      "But it should be noted that fragments of painted pottery have been\n",
      "found at Kuyunjik, which bear a striking resemblance to the early\n",
      "Syro-Cappadocian ware;[46] and these may well belong to a Neolithic\n",
      "settlement upon the site of Nineveh.[47] It is thus possible that the\n",
      "prehistoric culture, which had its seat in Elam, will be found to have\n",
      "extended to Southern Assyria also, and to non-alluvial sites on the\n",
      "borders of the Babylonian plain.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would seem that the influence of Sumerian culture during the\n",
      "historic period first began to be felt beyond the limits of Babylonia\n",
      "at the time of the Semitic expansion. The conquest of Syria by\n",
      "Shar-Gani-sharri undoubtedly had important results upon the spread of\n",
      "Babylonian culture. The record, which has been interpreted to mean\n",
      "that he went still further westward and crossed the Mediterranean to\n",
      "Cyprus, is now proved to have been due to the misunderstanding of a\n",
      "later scribe.[48] It is true that some seals have been found in Cyprus,\n",
      "which furnish evidence of Babylonian influence in the island, but they\n",
      "belong to a period considerably later than that of the Akkadian empire.\n",
      "Of these, the one said to have been found in the treasury of the temple\n",
      "at Curium by General di Cesnola refers to the deified NarÃ¢m-Sin,[49]\n",
      "but the style of its composition and its technique definitely prove\n",
      "that it is of Syro-Cappadocian workmanship, and does not date from a\n",
      "much earlier period than that of the First Dynasty of Babylon. The most\n",
      "cursory comparison of the seal with the clay-sealings of NarÃ¢m-Sin's\n",
      "period, which have been found at Tello,[50] will convince any one of\n",
      "this fact. The other, which was found in an early bronze age deposit at\n",
      "Agia Paraskevi with its original gold mounting, may be definitely dated\n",
      "in the period of the First Babylonian Dynasty,[51] and Nudubtum, its\n",
      "original owner, who styles himself a servant of the god Martu (Amurru),\n",
      "may well have been of Syrian or West Semitic origin. Beyond such\n",
      "isolated cylinders, there is, however, no trace of early Babylonian\n",
      "influence in Cyprus.[52] This is hardly compatible with the suggested\n",
      "Semitic occupation during Shar-Gani-sharri's reign; there may well\n",
      "have been a comparatively early trade connection with the island, but\n",
      "nothing more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet the supposed conquest of Cyprus by Shar-Gani-sharri has led to the\n",
      "wildest comparisons between Aegean and Babylonian art. Not content with\n",
      "leaving him in Cyprus, Professor Winckler has dreamed of still further\n",
      "maritime expeditions on his part to Rhodes, Crete, and even to the\n",
      "mainland of Greece itself.[53] There is no warrant for such imaginings,\n",
      "and the archaeologist must be content to follow and not outrun his\n",
      "evidence. Babylonian influence would naturally be stronger in Cyprus\n",
      "than in Crete, but with neither have we evidence of strong or direct\n",
      "contact. There are, however, certain features of Aegean culture which\n",
      "may be traced to a Babylonian source, though some of the suggested\n",
      "comparisons are hardly convincing. The houses at FÃ¢ra, for instance,\n",
      "are supplied with a very elaborate system of drainage, and drains and\n",
      "culverts have been found in the pre-Sargonic stratum at Nippur, at\n",
      "Surghul, and at most early Sumerian sites where excavations have been\n",
      "carried out. These have been compared with the system of drainage and\n",
      "sanitation at Knossos.[54] It is true that no other parallel to the\n",
      "Cretan system can be cited in antiquity, but, as a matter of fact, the\n",
      "two systems are not very like, and in any case it would be difficult\n",
      "to trace a path by which so early a connection could have taken place.\n",
      "It has indeed been suggested that both Babylonia and Crete may have\n",
      "inherited elements of some prehistoric culture common to the eastern\n",
      "world, and that what looks like an instance of influence may really\n",
      "be one of common origin.[55] But, as in the case of a few parallels\n",
      "between early Egyptian and Elamite culture, it is far more probable\n",
      "that such isolated points of resemblance are merely due to coincidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "A far more probable suggestion is that the clay tablet and stilus\n",
      "reached Crete from Babylonia.[56] Previous to its introduction the\n",
      "Minoan hieroglyphs, or pictographs, had been merely engraved on\n",
      "seal-stones, but with the adoption of the new material for writing they\n",
      "were employed for lists, inventories and the like, and these forms\n",
      "became more linear.[57] The fact that the cuneiform system of writing\n",
      "was not introduced along with the tablet, as happened in Anatolia, is\n",
      "sufficient proof that the connection between Babylonia and Crete was\n",
      "indirect. It was doubtless by way of Anatolia that the clay tablet\n",
      "travelled to Crete,[58] for the discoveries at Kara-Uyuk prove that,\n",
      "before the age of Hammurabi, both tablet and cuneiform writing had\n",
      "penetrated westward beyond the Taurus.[59] Through its introduction\n",
      "into Crete the Babylonian tablet may probably be regarded as the direct\n",
      "ancestor of the wax tablet and stilus of the Greeks and Romans.[60]\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike the clay tablet, the cylinder-seal never became a characteristic\n",
      "of the Aegean cultural area, where the seal continued to be of the\n",
      "stamp or button-form. A cylinder-seal has indeed been found in a\n",
      "larnax-burial at Palaikastro, on the east coast of Crete; and it is\n",
      "a true cylinder, perforated from end to end, and was intended to be\n",
      "rolled and not stamped upon the clay.[61] The designs upon it are\n",
      "purely Minoan, but the arrangement of the figures, which is quite\n",
      "un-Egyptian in character, is similar to that of the Mesopotamian\n",
      "cylinder.[62] In spite of the rarity of the type among Cretan seals,\n",
      "this single example from Palaikastro is suggestive of Babylonian\n",
      "influence, through the Syro-Cappadocian channel by which doubtless the\n",
      "clay tablet reached Crete.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anatolia thus formed a subsidiary centre for the further spread of\n",
      "Babylonian culture, which had reached it by way of Northern Syria\n",
      "before crossing the Taurus. The importance of the latter district in\n",
      "this connection has been already emphasized by Mr. Hogarth.[63] Every\n",
      "traveller from the coast to the region of the KhÃ¢bÃ»r will endorse\n",
      "his description of the vast group of mounds, the deserted sites of\n",

      "exceptions these still await the spade of the excavator, and, when\n",
      "their lowest strata shall have yielded their secrets, we shall know far\n",
      "more of the early stages in the spread of Babylonian culture westwards.\n",
      "We have already noted the rÃ´le of Syria as a connecting-link between\n",
      "the civilizations of the Euphrates and the Nile,[64] and it plays an\n",
      "equally important part in linking both of them with the centre of early\n",
      "Hittite culture in Asia Minor. It was by the coastal regions of Syria\n",
      "that the first Semitic immigrants from the south reached the Euphrates,\n",
      "and it was to Syria that the stream of Semitic influence, now\n",
      "impregnated with Sumerian culture, returned. The sea formed a barrier\n",
      "to any further advance in that direction, and so the current parted,\n",
      "and passed southwards into the Syro-Palestinian region and northwards\n",
      "through the Cilician Gates, whence by Hittite channels it penetrated to\n",
      "the western districts of Asia Minor. Here, again, the sea was a barrier\n",
      "to further progress westwards, and the Asiatic coast of the Aegean\n",
      "forms the western limit of Asiatic influence. Until the passing of the\n",
      "Hittite power, no attempts were made by Aegean sea-rovers or immigrants\n",
      "from the mainland of Greece to settle on the western coast of Asia\n",
      "Minor,[65] and it is not therefore surprising that Aegean culture\n",
      "should show such scanty traces of Babylonian influence.\n",

      "Of the part which the Sumerians took in originating and moulding the\n",
      "civilization of Babylonia, it is unnecessary to treat at greater\n",
      "length. Perhaps their most important achievement was the invention of\n",
      "cuneiform writing, for this in time was adopted as a common script\n",
      "throughout the east, and became the parent of other systems of the same\n",
      "character. But scarcely less important were their legacies in other\n",
      "spheres of activity. In the arts of sculpture and seal-engraving their\n",
      "own achievements were notable enough, and they inspired the Semitic\n",
      "work of later times. The great code of Hammurabi's laws, which is\n",
      "claimed to have influenced western codes besides having moulded much\n",
      "of the Mosaic legislation, is now definitely known to be of Sumerian\n",
      "origin, and Urukagina's legislative effort was the direct forerunner of\n",
      "Hammurabi's more successful appeal to past tradition. The literature of\n",
      "Babylon and Assyria is based almost throughout on Sumerian originals,\n",
      "and the ancient ritual of the Sumerian cults survived in the later\n",
      "temples of both countries. Already we see Gudea consulting the omens\n",
      "before proceeding to lay the foundations of E-ninnÃ», and the practice\n",
      "of hepatoscopy may probably be set back into the period of the\n",

      "Babylonian civilization, and a study of its culture supplies a key to\n",
      "many subsequent developments in Western Asia. The inscriptions have\n",

      "In the second chapter of this volume the opinion was expressed that,\n",
      "in spite of the unsoundness of certain arguments in favour of the\n",
      "theory, the original home of the Sumerians was to be sought beyond the\n",
      "mountains to the east of the Babylonian plain.[1] The arrival of the\n",
      "Sumerians on the banks of the Euphrates would thus have been a single\n",
      "episode in a series of similar migrations from the east, which, during\n",
      "the historical period, are known to have made their appearance in that\n",
      "quarter of Western Asia. Until recently it was only possible to suggest\n",
      "that such migratory movements were to be traced to racial unrest in\n",
      "more distant regions, and few data were available for supporting any\n",
      "detailed theory as to the causes of this occasional pressure westwards.\n",
      "Important evidence, which has both a direct and an indirect bearing\n",
      "on the problem, has, however, been obtained as a result of recent\n",
      "explorations in Russian and Chinese Turkestan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two expeditions conducted by Mr. Raphael Pumpelly, on behalf\n",
      "of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, in 1903 and 1904, the\n",
      "results of which have now been fully published, were occupied mainly\n",
      "with work in the Transcaspian province of Russian Turkestan. The\n",
      "physiographical observations collected by the first Pumpelly Expedition\n",
      "were supplemented during the second of them by archaeological evidence,\n",
      "obtained by excavations at Anau near Askhabad, and in the Merv Oasis,\n",
      "under the direction of Dr. Hubert Schmidt, of Berlin, who joined the\n",
      "staff of the expedition for that purpose. Both classes of evidence have\n",
      "a direct bearing upon the problem under discussion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of more remote interest, in the present connection, are the\n",
      "explorations and excavations carried out by Dr. Stein in Chinese\n",
      "Turkestan, on behalf of the Indian Government, during his journeys of\n",
      "1900-1 and 1906-8. Lying in the Tarim basin to the east of the Pamirs,\n",
      "the principal scene of his labours is far removed from those regions of\n",
      "Western and Central Asia from which direct light may be expected upon\n",
      "the Sumerian problem. But the Khotan oases and the Taklamakan Desert\n",
      "present in many respects an interesting parallel to the conditions\n",
      "prevailing in the southern districts of the Russian province; and\n",
      "they illustrate, during more recent historical periods, a climatic\n",
      "and geological process of which far earlier traces have been noted in\n",
      "the latter region. The investigation of the archaeological remains,\n",
      "till lately buried in Khotan, has also demonstrated the comparatively\n",
      "short period of time required for extensive physical changes to have\n",
      "taken place. Finally, the physiographical researches of Mr. Ellsworth\n",
      "Huntington, who accompanied the first Pumpelly expedition, have been\n",
      "extended during 1905-7 into the region of Dr. Stein's travels, along\n",
      "the southern and eastern borders of the Taklamakan Desert, and have\n",
      "resulted in obtaining corroborative evidence of theories already\n",
      "deduced from observations in Russian Turkestan.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has already been remarked that the work of the Pumpelly Expeditions\n",
      "was of a twofold character. On the one hand, the majority of the\n",
      "members devoted themselves to the collection of material bearing on the\n",
      "physiography of the Central Asian deserts and oases; and, as a result\n",
      "of their labours, they have produced a valuable series of monographs,\n",
      "illustrating climatic and physical changes which have taken place in\n",
      "that region of the world. On the other hand, the excavations conducted\n",
      "at Anau by Dr. Schmidt have been followed by a careful presentment of\n",
      "the archaeological material, including a very complete ceramic record.\n",
      "The general discussion of the results was undertaken by Mr. Raphael\n",
      "Pumpelly, the leader of the expeditions, who has given an able and\n",
      "suggestive summary of what he conceives to be their general bearing,\n",
      "not only from the geological side, but also in their relation to the\n",
      "early history of Western Asiatic, and even of North African culture.[2]\n",
      "At the outset it should be mentioned that, on the archaeological\n",
      "side, several of Mr. Pumpelly's generalizations appear to be too far\n",
      "reaching, and he seems to push some of his conclusions beyond the limit\n",
      "of his evidence. But this does not detract in any way from the value of\n",
      "the new data, which he has been largely instrumental in acquiring.\n",

      "has long been recognized that the deserts of Central Asia owe their\n",
      "existence to a process of desiccation that has taken place since\n",
      "the Glacial epoch,[3] and recent investigations have shown that the\n",
      "contrast to present conditions was even more marked than was previously\n",
      "supposed. The members of the first Pumpelly Expedition have noted that\n",
      "glaciers existed on a greatly extended scale throughout the mountains\n",
      "bordering the great basins of Central Asia on the south and east, and\n",
      "they have proved the existence of several great glacial expansions,\n",
      "each of which naturally reacted on the climate of the central region.\n",
      "During the sub-glacial period there was a general trend towards\n",
      "desolation, and the dried silts of seas and rivers were carried by\n",
      "the wind across the surface of the ground. The lightest material was\n",
      "carried farthest, and, wherever the scanty vegetation could hold it,\n",
      "it was deposited in beds of \"loess,\" the extraordinarily fine and\n",
      "fertile soil which covers a great part of Northern China and Turkestan,\n",
      "and extends in a continuous zone from North of the Caspian to Central\n",
      "Europe.[4] The heavier silts in the shape of sands moved more slowly\n",
      "under the pressure of the wind, and they formed great deserts of\n",
      "sand-dunes, heaped in places more than a hundred feet high. It is to\n",
      "the shifting or formation of such sand-deserts in historic times that\n",
      "we owe the burial of the cities in the Khotan region, which have been\n",
      "so successfully excavated by Dr. Stein for the Indian Government.[5]\n",
      "\n",
      "Although it is clear that since Glacial times there has been a general\n",
      "trend towards the present arid condition of Central Asia, there is\n",
      "reason to believe that, as in the Glacial epoch, the subsequent\n",
      "climatic changes have not been uniform. Periods of extreme aridity have\n",
      "occurred in which the condition of certain regions may have been more\n",
      "desolate than it is to-day. But these appear to have alternated with\n",
      "more humid periods, when the tracts which were deserted may again have\n",
      "been rendered capable of sustaining life. Already in the prehistoric\n",
      "period, however, the sea of sand-dunes had encroached upon the fertile\n",
      "plains of loess, and it is mainly in the delta-oases, formed by streams\n",
      "emerging from the mountains, or at points where large rivers lose\n",
      "themselves in the plain, as at Merv, that traces of man's handiwork\n",

      "Throughout the region of the oases in Southern Turkestan, to the north\n",
      "of the Kopet Dagh, the Pumpelly Expedition constantly noted the sites\n",
      "of former habitations in regions which are now desolate. Not only are\n",
      "there traces of occupation where villages exist to-day, but there are\n",
      "also large areas which must once have been densely peopled, although\n",
      "they are now deserted. The present supply of water in the region could\n",
      "support but a small proportion of its former inhabitants, and it is\n",
      "necessary to suppose either that there was a greater rainfall, or\n",
      "that evaporation was less rapid owing to a lower temperature. Similar\n",
      "evidence has been collected with regard to the former condition of\n",
      "Chinese Turkestan,[6] and it is clear that extensive tracts in Central\n",
      "Asia, which are now abandoned to the desert, at one time supported a\n",
      "considerable population. The evidence points to a change in climatic\n",
      "conditions, which has reacted on the character of the country in such a\n",
      "way as to cause racial migrations.[7]\n",

      "In the hope of throwing light on the character of the former dwellers\n",
      "in the deserted regions of Russian Turkestan, the second Pumpelly\n",
      "Expedition undertook excavations at selected sites. At Ghiaur Kala\n",
      "in the Merv Oasis it was ascertained that the earliest period of\n",
      "occupation was not older than a few centuries B.C., though it is\n",
      "probable that among the great number of mounds in the oasis some are\n",
      "of a considerably earlier date. Far more important were the results\n",
      "obtained by excavations in the region below the northern slopes of the\n",

      "of the North Kurgan, or tumulus, had already been exposed by a trench\n",

      "stratified remains, including bones of animals and potsherds of\n",
      "plain and painted wares. It was this trench that first directed Mr.\n",

      "The strata represented successive occupations of the site, and, as\n",
      "its inhabitants lived in houses built of sun-dried bricks, the hills\n",
      "gradually rose in height. Of the two hills, the North Kurgan was of\n",

      "Mr. Pumpelly himself would regard the Central Asian oases as the\n",
      "fountain-head of Western Asiatic culture. According to his theory, they\n",
      "were isolated from Europe and Africa from the Glacial period onwards,\n",
      "and their cultural requirements were evolved in complete independence.\n",
      "Changes in climatic conditions, however, took place, under which the\n",
      "early civilizations in these regions tended to disappear, and these\n",
      "gave rise to extensive migrations, which reacted in turn on the outside\n",
      "world. In support of his theory he would trace the early appearance\n",
      "of wheat and barley both in Egypt and Babylonia, and the presence of\n",
      "certain breeds of domestic animals, to their first establishment in the\n",
      "Transcaspian oases. But, in addition to differences in their ceramics,\n",
      "the total absence of any form of writing in the mounds at Anau tells\n",
      "against any theory necessitating a very close racial connection between\n",

      "The evidence, in fact, does not justify us in placing the original home\n",
      "of the Sumerians at Anau, nor indeed in any particular spot in Central\n",
      "Asia or Iran that has yet been examined. But it serves to indicate the\n",
      "region of the world in which we may expect that future excavations will\n",
      "reveal data of a more conclusive character. It may be that the ruined\n",
      "sites of Seistan and the Kirman province will exhibit closer parallels\n",
      "with the civilizations of Elam and Sumer. Meanwhile it is clear that\n",
      "some contact must have taken place between the early peoples of the\n",
      "latter countries and the settlements to the north of the Kopet Dagh.\n",
      "We may thus picture the Sumerians before their arrival in Babylonia as\n",
      "inhabitants of some district to the east of the Euphrates valley, where\n",
      "they evolved the elements of their culture, which is already found in\n",
      "a comparatively advanced stage of development on the earliest of South\n",
      "Babylonian sites.\n",
      "\n",
      "A further result of the recent explorations in Turkestan is that\n",
      "an adequate explanation is afforded of the unrest in Central Asia,\n",
      "which gave rise to the Sumerian immigration and to similar racial\n",
      "movements westward. It may now be regarded as established that periods\n",
      "of desiccation and extreme aridity have led to the abandonment of\n",
      "extensive tracts of country, with the result that their former\n",
      "inhabitants have, from time to time, been forced to seek sanctuary in\n",
      "more favoured districts. While nomad tribes in their search for fresh\n",
      "pasturage might drift over the broad steppes to the north and west of\n",
      "Turkestan, the agricultural peoples on its southern border would be\n",
      "forced to turn south of the Caspian. The bleak uplands of the Iranian\n",
      "plateau offer small attractions for permanent settlement, and the\n",
      "routes of the migrant tribes would naturally lead in the direction\n",
      "of Asia Minor and the Mesopotamian plain. Such a condition of unrest\n",
      "in Central Asia would naturally react on peoples at a considerable\n",
      "distance, and this fact explains the periodical invasions to which\n",
      "Babylonia has been subjected from the east. It may be added that\n",
      "the immigration of Semitic tribes into Syria and Northern Babylonia\n",
      "should possibly be traced to physical causes of a like nature. Periods\n",
      "of aridity may have occurred in the central portions of the Arabian\n",
      "continent, and may have given rise to the Semitic invasions of\n",
      "prehistoric and historic times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus it is possible that the two races, which we find in possession of\n",
      "Sumer and Akkad during the earliest historical periods, though they\n",
      "arrived from opposite quarters, were forced into the region of the\n",
      "Euphrates by causes of a precisely similar character. As the Semites,\n",
      "on their way northwards from Arabia, colonized the Syrian coast-lands\n",

      "West Mesopotamian sites will throw a flood of light upon the problems\n",
      "of early Semitic history, and it may perhaps fall to the lot of a\n",
      "fortunate excavator, in some region east of the Euphrates valley, to\n",
      "recover the cult-images of primitive Sumerian gods, and to bring to\n",
